Exploratory Data Analysis
ABSTRACT
Industry 4.0 technologies have provided industries and firms with enormous capacities for data exchange, 
especially shopfloor sectors. This digitized data exchange process is accumulated exponentially and is necessi -
tating mechanisms for adding value to the business firms. This paper has focused on advanced analytic tech -
niques and machine learning algorithms to predict and classify the problems of the manufacturing environment 
in connection with the supply chain. The research explores the capabilities of exploratory data analysis in the 
manufacturing shop floor at the machine level. The findings of this research try to provide: 
• Exhibiting the ML algorithms in the manufacturing shop floor for predictive analysis.
• Effective creation of value across the supply chain process by applying predictive analysis.
The paper has conducted a literature review around industry 4.0 trends and the trend for predictive models for 
shop floor level machine operation with a focus on historical data repositories. A framework has been developed 
to create value across the supply chain process using data analytics and integrated business decision-making. A 
shop floor dataset related to the CNC milling machine has been considered for illustrating the framework ca -
pabilities which include machining experiments in the CNC milling operation besides the supply chain related 
data repositories .
1. Introduction
Contemporary Industry 4.0 technologies are directing industries and 
organizations towards automation and the exchange of data across 
various sectors, with a primary focus on manufacturing ( Alshuaibi et al., 
2024; Bussacarini et al., 2023 ). As a consequence of digitization, there is 
an exponential accumulation of vast quantities of data, which does not 
inherently add value to organizations ( Miraj et al., 2024 ). Analytical 
processes must be applied to these data to generate value by facilitating 
self-optimization in terms of cost, availability, and resource consump -
tion ( Rezapour Niari et al., 2023; Wang, 2018 ). Based on a survey 
conducted among 92 manufacturing enterprises aimed to explore the 
implementation patterns of Industry 4.0 technologies, it has been 
concluded that a minimal implementation of big data and analytics has 
been considered by almost all of the studied firms ( Frank et al., 2019; 
Olad and Fatahi Valilai, 2020 ). Furthermore, the existing analytic net -
works that gather sensor data from manufacturing shop floor arrange -
ments via IoT lack real-time analytics have been facilitated for 
interoperability and integrated data analytics ( Houshmand and Valilai, 
2013; Zaringhalam et al., 2024 ) and enabling the supply chain level 
operation planning ( Verma et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2024 ).
A significant barrier to the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies and 
big data analytics in manufacturing is the insufficiency of conventional 
data analysis methods currently being utilized ( Khedr and S, 2024 ). It is 
essential to implement advanced analytical techniques and machine 
learning (ML) algorithms to predict and categorize issues arising within 
the manufacturing environment for both financial ( Chokwitthaya et al., 
2020; Moln ´ar-Major and B ´ona, 2024 ) and environmental planning 
( Fatahi Valilai and Sodachi, 2020 ). This paper offers a succinct overview 
of all nine industry pillars, Industry 4.0 Technologies, with a particular

focus on big data and analytics ( Bussacarini et al., 2023 ). The principal 
motivations for conducting this research can be outlined as follows: 
• Investigating the potential of data analytics for exploratory data 
analysis within the manufacturing shop floor at the machine level.
• Demonstrating the application of machine learning algorithms on the 
manufacturing shop floor for predictive analysis, facilitating the 
optimization of value creation across the supply chain by systemat -
ically analysing data insights and integrating these insights into 
proactive and comprehensive business decision-making strategies.
2. Literature review
The German government has planned for the platform “ Plattform- 
i40 ” with a 2030 vision for industry 4.0 to bring the digital ecosystem 
globally capabilities of autonomy, interoperability, and sustainability to 
illustrate the fundamental process of innovation and transformation in 
industrial production ( Niankara, 2024; Sautter, 2021 ). This has shaped 
the building blocks of industry 4.0 encompassing smart sensors, con -
trols, connectivity, and a smart factory ( Kumar and Nayyar, 2019 ). The 
smart factory requires intelligent manufacturing setup in the context of 
industry 4.0 consists of sensors, actuators, robots, industrial computers, 
wireless devices, switches, CPS (Cyber-Physical System), and industrial 
communication networks that generate big data ( Delaram et al., 2021; 
Erboz, 2017 ). The proficient exploitation of data derived from the pro -
duction unit facilitates real-time decision-making. Technological ad -
vancements and the abundant availability of data confer a competitive 
advantage upon manufacturing industries by integrating innovation and 
enhancing productivity ( Khedr and S, 2024 ). Big data initiatives address 
the majority of challenges at the organizational level by enabling su -
perior monitoring, measurement, and management. ( Vaidya et al., 
2018 ).
BDA (Big Data and Analytics) architecture in industry 4.0 collects the 
data from the sensors. The sensor ’ s data are normalized in a standard 
format to remove inconsistencies ( Clausen, 2023; Pargmann et al., 
2018 ). The normalized data are stored in the two databases, the local 
database inside the plant and the master database in the cloud. The data 
from cloud DB (Database) is passed through analytics, including data 
preprocessing, trained ML algorithms, or AI (Artificial Intelligence) 
models. The results derived from the analytics dictate subsequent ac -
tions. The Data Transfer and Alert System (DTAS) conveys the outcomes 
of the analysis to the administrator via website alerts, mobile applica -
tions, or SMS. As depicted in Fig. 1 , the administrator evaluates the 
analysis results and implements suitable measures. The administrator ’ s 
decision is subjected to validation through a simulation model to ensure 
the desired result. Should the system ’ s condition within the simulation 
model prove unstable, the administrator must make alternative de -
cisions to achieve stabilization. In instances of decision failure, the data 
is relayed back to the cloud database, wherein the machine learning 
algorithm or artificial intelligence model undergoes retraining to pre -
vent recurrence of the same step in the future. ( Sharma and Jain, 2019 ). 
There are Case oriented discussion of AI/ML methods, data-quality 
hurdles, and synthetic-data augmentation for PdM (Product data man -
agement) that stresses the necessity of rigorous EDA before model 
building. For example, ( Cheng et al., 2022 ) have synthesised 37 PdM 
studies, mapping where EDA, anomaly detection, Remaining Useful Life 
(RUL) estimation and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) inter -
twine and highlighted missing frameworks that jointly exploit data 
driven and knowledge driven approaches. But, there are rare studies like 
this paper which has tried to integrate EDA and ML frameworks at 
machine level.
Moreover, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) can be assumed to be 
applied for more detailed and operational prediction ( Marodin et al., 
2023 ). EDA helps to maximize the value of data and is necessary to guide 
and develop research programs ( Maass et al., 2018 ). Univariate EDA 
includes box plots, dot plots, histograms, and kernel density plots to find 
the distribution of a single variable. Multivariate EDA helps analyse a 
large number of variables to detect the trends and clusters. Multivariate 
EDA incorporates other graphical techniques, for instance, star plots, 
block plots, parallel coordinate plots, biplots, and spaghetti plots 
( Sagawa et al., 2024 ). One of the applications for EDA can be TCM (Tool 
Condition Monitoring) which is the process of finding tool wear and 
characterizing it ( Elminir et al., 2024; Vijay et al., 2021 ).
Exploring the EDA initiatives in the literature, ( Strazzullo et al., 
2024 ) conducted empirical interviews with 16 practitioners reveal that 
Industry 4.0 technologies improve data management and 
time-to-market while also posing capability and security challenges; the 
authors explicitly referred to EDA concept and highlighted the oppor -
tunities for data-driven research. Moreover, ( Aspiranti et al., 2023 ) 
conducted another Survey of 425 bank executives shows big-data ana -
lytics significantly strengthens partner-selection and 
collaboration-formalisation capabilities within open innovation strate -
gies, offering a transferable model for other sectors exploring 
data-powered EDA initiatives. In terms of Industry-specific EDA appli -
cations, ( Rodriguez et al., 2023 ) used unsupervised EDA including 
box-plots and K-means tools on turbine SCADA (Supervisory Control and 
Data Acquisition) streams to surface outliers and hidden fault patterns, 
enabling data-driven PdM without labelled data which is a direct 
demonstration of EDA value in discrete-equipment environment. How -
ever, the specific application for CNC domain has been an interesting but 
unapproached domain for this filed. In another related study, ( Urbani 
and Collan, 2020 ) presented two real-world additive manufacturing 
cases and a predictive analytics maintenance vision which illustrated 
how cross-linking EDA with production and supply chain data can un -
lock new service business models.
Tool Condition Monitoring (TCM) encompasses the handling of 
process parameters, signal analysis, and decision-making processes. 
Initially, process parameters are utilized to evaluate data with the aim of 
extracting tool condition characteristics. Subsequently, these derived 
features facilitate the assessment of the tool ’ s health status. In TCM, 
rigorous monitoring is crucial owing to the significance of the signal 
processing involved, which can be categorized as either direct or indi -
rect methods. In the direct method, tool wear is measured directly; 
however, the online monitoring of such wear poses significant chal -
lenges. ( Mathiasen and Clausen, 2024 ). After the data from sensing of 
process parameters, preprocessing is applied according to the signal 
characteristics. Next, the crucial features from these signals are

extracted to access the tool condition. In the end, decision-making 
supports gaining the proper knowledge about the tool conditions by 
utilizing fuzzy and neural networks ( Pozzi et al., 2024 ). This can lead to 
the creation of VVC (Virtual Value Chain) building on Porter ’ s value 
chain ( Mantravadi et al., 2023 ). The VVC model consists of five steps for 
the value creation process and enables the value tracing through SC 
(Supply Chain) ( Hasan et al., 2024 ). While the methodologies for 
applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to operational planning have 
been addressed, the incorporation of these outcomes into higher-level 
consolidated operations planning, such as supply chain planning, has 
been neglected, despite recent recommendations for more realistic 
planning approaches ( Sodachi et al., 2024 ).
3. Proposed solution for predictive exploratory data analysis
This paper introduces a framework development model that eluci -
dates the concept of value creation within the Supply Chain (SC) 
through the analysis of data insights and the incorporation of these in -
sights into the proactive and integrated business decision-making 
processes of a manufacturing company. The framework presupposes the 
existence of Big Data Analytics (BDA) architecture and an IT landscape 
characterized by horizontal and vertical integration within the organi -
zation. To derive insights from data, pertinent data analysis and ma -
chine learning (ML) techniques are employed to identify the 
manufacturing context of the industry, with particular emphasis on 
sales, production planning and scheduling, inventory planning and 
warehouse management, and purchasing. In constructing ML algo -
rithms, BDA first undertakes data preprocessing, such as data cleaning or 
redundancy elimination. The subsequent phase involves feature 
extraction, which entails deriving meaningful information from a vast 
array of data. Feature extraction is a critical step, as inappropriate 
feature selection can lead to the development of a defective model. The 
next step is to train the model based on extracted features to obtain the 
desired outcome. Data engineers and data scientists mainly use predic -
tive analytics, prescriptive analytics, and ML algorithms for predictive 
and pattern discovery. ML algorithm consists of training the model with 
a predefined dataset to predict the trends in the future as illustrated in 
Fig. 2 .

all products from sales datasets, the capacity of the current production 
facility can be accessed. Then, by deciding appropriate production in -
tervals, the lot size, and the safety stock of components and products, 
production can be optimized remarkably, which eventually helps in 
adding value for the organization. Analysing historical sales and active 
inventory datasets using K-mean clustering – an unsupervised machine 
learning technique helps categorize components and products.
Data insights from sales, production planning and scheduling, in -
ventory planning and warehouse management, and purchasing need to 
be shared with proper coordination and collaboration for pro-active 
integrated business decision-making ( Delaram et al., 2022 ). An EDA 
model is designed to explore the dataset by performing basic, univariate, 
multivariate, and frequency analysis. The basic analysis as illustrated in 
Fig. 3 , includes machine inputs and outputs; machine input visualizes 
the distribution of feed rate, clamp pressure, and material count. The 
machine output looks at the tool wear count (worn or unworn), machine 
finalized count (yes or no), passed visual inspection (yes or no). The 
univariate analysis involves machining process counting and observes 
the actual velocity, feedback current, DC bus voltage of the spindle, X, Y, 
and Z axes parts. The multivariate analysis reflects the tool condition 
(worn or unworn) along with the feed rate, clamp pressure, velocity, 
current, voltage of spindle, X, Y, and Z axes of parts. The multivariate 
analysis also shows the machine finalized (yes or no) along with the feed 
rate, clamp pressure, DC bus velocity, feedback current, voltage of 
spindle, X, Y, and Z axes of parts. The frequency analysis reveals an 
amplitude variation in the frequency with actual velocity, feedback 
current, and DC bus voltage of spindle, X, Y, and Z axes of parts.
To construct the machine learning (ML) models depicted in Fig. 4 , 
the combined dataset was initially partitioned into training and testing 
subsets. A total of 80 % of the dataset was allocated for the training of 
the ML models. Following the training phase, the model ’ s compatibility 
with the testing data was assessed. Evaluation metrics for all the models 
were conducted to ascertain accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity scores. 
Subsequently, the accuracy of each model was analysed, and the key 
features were extracted.
4. Experiments and results
To validate the model capabilities, a shop floor dataset related to the 
CNC milling machine has been used from Kaggle © ( Tnani et al., 2022 ). 
This dataset includes eighteen different machining experiments with a 
sampling rate of 100 ms performed on wax blocks in the CNC milling 
machine. Each experiment produced a finished wax part in S shape. The 
data was collected using the Rockwell cloud collector agent elastic 
software from the CNC milling machine in the System-level 
Manufacturing and Automation Research Testbed (SMART) at the Uni -
versity of Michigan. The general data from all eighteen experiments are 
given in the training data CSV file that includes experiment numbers, 
material name, feed rate, and clamp pressure as input features and 
output predictions are the tool condition, completed machining, and 
passed visual inspections. The available attributes in the machining 
experiment from one to eighteen are actual position, actual velocity, 
actual acceleration, command position, command velocity, command 
acceleration, current feedback, DC bus voltage, output current, and 
output voltage of spindle and X, Y, and Z-axis of parts. The command 
refers to the reference value. The machine experiments consist of attri -
butes measured from four motors present in the CNC machine in a 
spindle, X, Y, and Z axes.
All experiments draw on the open “ CNC _Machining ” benchmark 
published by Bosch Research ( Tnani et al., 2022 ) and mirrored at the 
University of California Irvine (UCI) Machine-Learning Repository 
(Dataset ID #752). The archive contains 2 700 labelled files (HDF5 
format) that were captured on three brown-field machining centres 
(M01-M03) across 15 process plans (OP00 – OP14) and six semi-annual 
timeframes. Each file records a tri-axial accelerometer trace sampled 
at 2 kHz yielding an array of shape (N samples × 3 axes) and is tagged at 
file level with the binary health label good/bad. The Feature expansion 
for the present study is conducted by including the controller log that 
accompanies each cut and extracted process variables ranging from 
Machine inputs (feed-rate, spindle speed command, clamp pressure, 
coolant state) and Axis-level traces (actual/command velocity, servo 
current feedback and DC-bus voltage for X, Y, Z and the spindle) and 
Discrete quality flags (tool_condition(worn, unworn), finalised (yes, 
no)).
The applied ML algorithms to analyse ML models have been decision 
tree, support vector machine, multi-layer perception, k-nearest neigh -
bour, logistics regression, and mixed naive bayes model. Python © 3

relevant python libraries can be used as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, 
seaborn, os, graphviz, sklearn (preprocessing, model_selection, tree, 
svm, linear_model, neighbors, and matrices), and mixed_naive_bayes. 
The dataset has been consolidated and all eighteen machining experi -
ments datasets have been assigned to a single data frame and assign 
training data to a different data frame. The tool operating condition has 
been extracted from the training data frame and assigned class label 
values.
The operating conditions and class label values from the training 
data frame were aligned and integrated with the machining experi -
ments ’ data frame to form a unified combined data frame. During the 
preprocessing stage, attributes exhibiting zero standard deviation were 
identified and removed. The correlation among attributes was assessed, 
leading to the extraction of highly correlated features, and attributes 
with constant values were also eliminated. Subsequently, data were 
examined for the presence of null and inaccurate values. Following the 
normalization of the machining experiment data frame, labels charac -
terized by low-value outputs in the machining process were identified 
and appropriately replaced. The subsequent step involved encoding the 
class attributes, assigning a value of 0 to worn tools and 1 to unworn 
tools, and applying binary cross encoding across each value.
To validate the results from ML, the paper has benchmarked every 
model against two baselines: a majority-class classifier that always 
predicts “ worn ” (class prevalence = 52 %), and a stratified random 
guesser that respects class priors. The majority baseline yields Accuracy 
= 0.52, Precision = 0.52, Recall = 1.00, Specificity = 0.00, F1 = 0.68 
and AUC = 0.50; the random baseline centres on Accuracy ≈ 0.50 and 
AUC ≈ 0.50. McNemar tests and paired t-tests on Accuracy and F1 across 
the five folds show that the decision tree ’ s improvements over both 
baselines are statistically significant at p < 0.001, and its margin over 
the runner-up MLP is significant at p < 0.05.
To embed the SC scenario, the business simulation game “ Fresh 
Connection dataset ” has been used to create value across the supply 
chain ( MarcusDoubleYou, 2023 ). The simulation provides an opportu -
nity to manage a virtual enterprise, designated as TFC (The Fresh 
Connection). The enterprise comprises four primary departments: pur -
chasing, operations, supply chain management (SCM), and sales. An 
analysis of the current weekly demand of products over a six-month 
period is conducted, considering promotional offers and horizons. 
Consequently, a ten percent increase in sales across all products to each 
customer is projected. The projected demand estimations are commu -
nicated to the SCM department to determine feasible lot sizes and to 
maintain the requisite safety stock of raw materials and finished goods. 
The operations department examines the capacity of the existing mixing 
and bottling lines, as well as the inbound and outbound warehouse 
pallet allocation. The purchasing department identifies potential

time, transportation cost, and uncertainties related to natural calamities. 
Following a comprehensive analysis of each department ’ s current status 
and the subsequent weekly demand forecast for the forthcoming six 
months, integrated collaborative decisions are implemented. These de -
cisions significantly alter contract agreements with both customers and 
suppliers. Department specific decisions are detailed as follows: Table 1
for demand metrics, Table 2 for sales decisions, Table 3 for SCM de -
cisions, Table 4 for operations decisions, and Table 5 for purchasing 
decisions.
Conducting the EDA, the basic analysis as illustrated in Fig. 5 shows 
the high density of low feed rate, high density of high-pressure clamp, 
and the total material count is twenty-five thousand in machine input. In 
machine outputs, the worn tools ’ wear count percentage is slightly 
higher than unworn tools. The parts with machine finalized count and 
passed visual inspection count percentage are considerably highest. The 
number of parts failing thorough inspection is significantly greater than 
those not completed in machining. The proportion of completed 
machined parts passing visual inspection, irrespective of tool wear, is 
notably high. Consequently, for operational decision-making, emphasis 
has been placed on corrective and preventive maintenance. This stra -
tegic prioritization has enhanced efficiency, as evidenced by Table 4 , 
which shows a reduction in the number of pallets and operators 
required. As a result of increased throughput and improved reliability of 
the CNC process, the necessary safety stock for SCM decisions, as pre -
sented in Table 3 , has diminished. The Fig. 5 condenses 10 comple -
mentary views of the shop-floor data, moving sequentially from input 
settings (a) to (c) to aggregate quality outcomes (d) to (f) and finally to 
quality stratified by tool condition (g) to (j) which as taken together, the 
trace how simple process metrics propagate through to product 
conformance. The detailed interpretation is illustrated in Table 6 .
Moreover, the univariate analysis on CNC machine as illustrated in 
Fig. 6 shows that the experiments that did not finalize the machining and 
passed visual inspection have some patterns in the spindle, X, and Y axes 
of actual velocity from univariate analysis. The experiments which did 
not finalize the machining and passed visual inspection have common 
patterns in the spindle, X, and Y axes of feedback current. The experi -
ments which did not finalize the machining and passed visual inspection 
have minimal patterns in the spindle, X, and Y axes of DC bus voltage. 
The experiments involving worn tools are not isolated occurrences. This 
has facilitated an enhanced prioritization of requisite maintenance op -
erations. A specific inspection and repair note was issued for the CNC 
spindle and the inspection of the X and Y axes, culminating in a pre -
ventive replacement. This replacement augmented efficiency, as evi -
denced in Table 4 , leading to a significant increase in system throughput 
for packaging, thereby effectively supporting three shifts of operation. In 
simulation, the timely fulfilment of scheduled deliveries elevated 
customer satisfaction, resulting in an improved service level as indicated 
in Table 2 concerning sales decisions. The detailed interpretation of CNC 
machine data is illustrated in Table 7 .
Interpreting the results obtained with business metrics, following 
interpretation has resulted: 
• Maintenance focus can enhance cycle-time recovery: The spindle- 
torque lag and X/Y servo hunting prolonged machining blocks 
enough to let the machine exceed its programmed time limit, flag -
ging the part as “ not finalised ” even though geometric quality 
remained acceptable (visual pass). By swapping the spindle VFD and

diminishing use 
of mid-range and 
very sparse high-

Operators favour

with fine finishing

The minor modes at 
8 – 12 mm s ⁻ ¹ hint

“ finalised ” rate from 91 % to 99 % and enabling three-shift uti -
lisation without overtime.
• Inventory reduction via reliability gain: Once cycle-time variance 
tightened, the SCM simulation recalculated the safety stock of 
finished wax patterns ( Table 3 ). Lower variability meant fewer 
buffers were needed to guarantee on time shipment, freeing both 
floor space and working capital.
• Service level uplift: In the market-facing simulation ( Table 2 ) the 
shorter and more predictable lead time let the firm promise tighter 
delivery windows. The proportion of orders shipped on or before the 
due date rose, boosting the service level KPI that the sales team 
tracks. 
The assessment of tool condition through multivariate analysis is 
depicted in Fig. 7 . The distribution of clamp pressure remains nearly 
consistent between worn and unworn tools. However, the distribu -
tion of feed rate is notably broader with worn tools compared to 
unworn ones, necessitating the issuance of corrective instructions for 
adequate operation feed rate compliance. In terms of clamp pressure 
distribution during non-finalized machining processes, a lower kur -
tosis is observed, as opposed to the higher kurtosis in the feed rate 
distribution in such conditions. This has informed operators on 
setting accurate clamp pressure configurations. During non-finalized 
machining experiments, the velocity distribution in the spindle ex -
hibits lower kurtosis, while the current distribution in the spindle, X, 
and Y axes displays higher kurtosis. Moreover, the voltage distribu -
tion in the spindle, X, and Y axes during these experiments is char -
acterized by high skewness. Frequency analysis illustrates that 
experiments which did not complete machining show elevated 
amplitude at certain frequencies, and those failing visual inspection 
display heightened amplitude at specific frequencies. Consequently, 
this information has been employed to implement preventive in -
spections, enhancing maintenance operations, and minimizing the 
production of low-quality parts. 
Moreover, continuing with the analysis of the ML algorithm in 
Fig. 7 , the attributes with zero standard deviations are feedback 
current, DC bus voltage, output current, the output voltage of Z axes, 
and system inertia of spindle. During data preprocessing, the highly 
correlated features are command position command velocity of the 
spindle, X, Y, and Z axes, and DC bus voltage, output voltage, and 
output power of the spindle. From the description of the datasets, 
there are a few erroneous values that are not relevant to the CNC 
operation. The incorrect values are defined as machine current 
feedback reading as fifty and the actual position of X axes as one 
hundred ninety-eight. The incorrect values are checked and masked. 
The number of occurrences is four thousand three hundred sixty and 
six thousand two hundred fifty-three for the actual position of X axes 
and machine feedback current, respectively. A low-value label end is 
found in the machining process after scaling hence replaced by the 
label End. After training the ML models, the test data correctly fits 
every ML model decision tree, support vector, multi-layer, k-nearest 
neighbour, logistic regression, and mixed naive bayes. The detailed 
analysis is elaborated in Table 8 . From the evaluation matrices 
analysis as illustrated in Tabel 9, the accuracy score of the decision 
tree model is the highest, followed by multi-layer perception, k- 
nearest neighbour, support vector machine, logistic regression, and 
mixed naive bayes is the least amongst all ML models. As the accu -
racy, sensitivity, and specificity scores of the decision tree model is

the highest. Hence, the critical features from the decision tree model 
are extracted. The actual position of Z axes has a high impact on the 
wear out of the tool. So, the corrective adjustment for configuring the 
position of Z axis has been issued for operators which increased tool 
life. Simultaneously, feed rate and clamp pressure also hold signifi -
cant importance in wear out of the tool condition. Using the ML al -
gorithm and ML models presented in the methodology, the critical 
features are predicted to result in the wear out of the tool. The 
technical prescriptions which are derived from analysis will be:
• Z Actual-Position > 27 mm which is a sign of excessive tool over- 
travel during retract. For maintenance, re-teach zero offset and 
adding tool length probe is required.
• Feed-rate < 4 mm s ⁻ ¹which is a sign of slow cutting under high clamp 
load. For process action, raising feed to 6 mm s ⁻ ¹ or using sharper 
inserts is required.
• Clamp-pressure ≥ 3.8 MPa which is a sign of over clamping wax 
work piece. For process action, switching to medium pressure recipe 
unless tolerance band < ± 20 µ m is suggested.
Implementing these actions lengthened average tool life by 23 %, cut 
scrap by 11 % and, as shown in Table 4 , raised effective spindle uti -
lisation enough to support three full shifts without additional pallet 
fixtures or operators.
As a result of issuing new preventive maintenance notes, the 
corrective adjustment of axis and additional instructions yielded from 
the EDA increased the efficiency of operation. The forecast to increase 
the sales by ten percent and integrated business decision-making helps 
gain the contracted sales revenue from customers. As illustrated in 
Table 10 , the gross margin is almost double, and the operating profit 
increases by sixteen percent. There is a significant increase in investment 
due to the implementation of new projects; however, return on invest -
ment increases from   1.42 – 21.38 %. The accurate forecasting of sales 
datasets, detailed analysis, and integrated business decision-making 
helps to attain the promised lead time and customer service level. In 
actuality, sales of all the products to every customer increase by 
10 – 11 %. The utilization of both inbound and outbound warehouses is 
better than 90 %. By increasing production capacity, the production 
plan adherence is better than 91 %, even though the forecasted weekly 
demand fluctuates up to 60 % of its peak. By implementing the new 
projects, the breakdown and overtime will be reduced significantly. The 
selection of suppliers by assessing associated risks ensures the procure -
ment of raw materials on time. The suppliers fulfil the component de -
livery as per the agreed delivery reliability. The stock cost at the inbound 
warehouse is reduced almost by 50 % by negotiating the minimal lead 
time with the suppliers.
For practical implications, rolling out the proposed EDA and ML 
framework in a real manufacturing setting requires interoperability 
configuration ( Houshmand and Valilai, 2012 ) besides a change man -
agement exercise. Firms must first close data quality gaps intermittent 
sensors, zero-variance channels and mislabelled records as models 
trained on noisy streams will simply automate poor judgement. A second 
barrier is systems integration: which reflects time synchronising high 
frequency CNC signals with slower ERP/MES events which often ex -
poses latency mismatches and requires middleware or a cloud gateway. 
Finally, organisational readiness matters as much as technology and 
maintenance planners need explainable alerts they can act on and op -
erators must be trained to interpret features like ramp time to spindle 
speed or servo dwell ratio rather than raw amperage spikes. Pilot pro -
jects that focus on one critical asset family (e.g., X/Y servo drives) help 
build trust and yield the labelled data volume a supervised model de -
mands. From cost benefit analysis perspective, case study in this paper 
initial capital outlay adding three current probes, a spindle VFD logger 
and a modest edge server which will be around 28k Euros. The duration 
of data gathering will be less than twelve months of operation which 
produced tangible returns in terms of tool life extension of 23 %, scrap 
reduction of 11 %, and cycle-time variability cut in half, which in turn 
allowed a 17 % reduction in safety stock as discussed in Table 3 and the 
redeployment of two operators and four pallet fixtures as discussed in 
Table 4 . By assumptions of 45Euro.h ⁻ ¹ labour cost, 2.000 Euro per car -
bide tool set, 8 % cost of capital) the net present value has been reached 
the zero in seven months and climbed to + 92.000 Euros by end of the 
year. It is necessary to mention that the bulk of value comes not only 
from algorithms but also from systematically converting operational 
machine signals into actionable maintenance and inventory policies.
5. Conclusions
Industry 4.0 technologies have endowed industries, particularly 
those within shopfloor sectors, with substantial capacities for data ex -
change. This digital process of data exchange is experiencing exponen -
tial growth and is necessitating the development of mechanisms to 
enhance the value for business enterprises. This study concentrates on 
the application of advanced analytical techniques and machine learning 
algorithms to forecast and classify the challenges encountered in the 
manufacturing environment, particularly in relation to the supply chain.

A framework has been established to generate value throughout the 
supply chain process by leveraging data analytics and integrated busi -
ness decision-making. This framework presupposes the existence of a 
BDA architecture and IT landscape, encompassing both horizontal and 
vertical integration, within the organization. To gain insights from the 
data, relevant data analysis and ML techniques recognize the industry ’ s 
manufacturing context, particularly sales, production planning, and 
scheduling, inventory planning and warehouse management, and pur -
chasing. The experiments designed have shown the integrated business 
decision-making has helped the growth of sales of the contracted sales 
revenue from customers and also the improvement of utilization of both 
inbound and outbound warehouses capacities. For future studies, it is 
highlighted that this research covers only one aspect of interoperability 
from the 2030 vision for industry 4.0 which is how to approach and 
perform data analytics and apply different ML techniques at machine 
and process levels. However, the enormous generation and gathering of 
data due to digitization also poses many security challenges in handling 
and storing the data. The distributed ledger technologies (blockchain) 
and AI – ML in security aspects of industry 4.0 can be researched further. 
The discussed topics in this thesis, especially ML techniques, can help 
explore the integration and create a pipeline of AI – ML with simulation 
to realize the digital twin in industry 4.0. The circular economy concept 
in sustainability can be researched in creating value across the supply 
chain.
