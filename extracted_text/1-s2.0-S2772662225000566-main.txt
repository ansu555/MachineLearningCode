The rapid  advancement of Big Data technologies has significantly influenced multiple sectors, with the retail 
industry being a key impact area. This study explores the relationship between Big Data analytics and consumer 
behavior, focusing on supermarket transaction data to extract macroeconomic insights. Using a dataset of 
over two million records from a multinational supermarket chain, the research employs a suite of advanced 
analytical techniques, including the Apriori algorithm for association rule mining, K-Means clustering for 
customer segmentation, collaborative filtering for recommendation systems, and AutoRegressive Integrated 
Moving Average (ARIMA) for time series forecasting. The study identifies purchasing patterns, segment-specific 
preferences, and temporal shopping behaviors. The results reveal distinct associations among frequently co-
purchased products, clear segmentations based on shopping habits, and predictive trends in consumer demand, 
offering valuable input for marketing, inventory management, and policy-making. Beyond the operational 
insights, this study highlights the potential of transactional data to reflect broader economic shifts, such 
as changes in consumption patterns during periods of economic uncertainty, thus linking consumer micro-
behaviors to macroeconomic indicators. The novelty of this work lies in its integration of multiple machine 
learning techniques within a unified framework that connects retail analytics to economic policymaking, 
thereby extending the application of Big Data from commercial strategy to public economics. 
1. Introduction
In the digital era, the unprecedented generation and accumula-
tion of data have propelled Big Data to the forefront of industrial 
innovation. In retail, extensive datasets from transactions, loyalty pro-
grams, and online platforms provide vital information on consumer 
behavior. This research explores Big Data and consumer behavior via 
supermarket analytics, aiming to uncover significant patterns with 
macroeconomic relevance [1].
Big Data, characterized by volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and 
value, surpasses traditional data processing capacities. Supermarket 
data, derived from diverse sources such as point-of-sale systems and 
loyalty programs, enables analysis of consumer behavior, informing 
business strategies and economic policies.
Understanding consumer behavior involves examining purchasing 
decisions and responses to market stimuli. Insights gained optimize 
product offerings, refine marketing strategies, and inform broader eco-
nomic policymaking. Supermarket analytics employs advanced tech-
niques such as machine learning and data mining to predict trends and

the various factors that shape these decisions. This involves under-
standing consumer preferences for specific products, analyzing their 
responses to marketing strategies, and evaluating the influence of eco-
nomic conditions on their purchasing power [1,2]. Gaining insight into 
consumer behavior is crucial for retailers as it allows them to optimize 
their product offerings, tailor their marketing initiatives to individual 
preferences, and enhance overall customer satisfaction. Furthermore, 
these insights have broader implications as they can be used to in-
form economic policies and strategies to foster economic growth and 
stability.

thorough processing and analysis of supermarket data. The gathered 
insights serve as a foundation for predicting future sales trends, fine-
tuning inventory management processes, and crafting tailored market-
ing strategies that effectively resonate with consumer preferences and 
behavior.
This study addresses supermarkets’ challenges in understanding 
customer behavior using Big Data analytics, examining transaction data 
to provide insights into economic influences on consumer decisions. 
Through advanced techniques like machine learning, time series analy-
sis, clustering, and association rule mining using the Apriori algorithm, 
this research aims to uncover intricate patterns and trends in consumer 
purchasing behavior.
Although this study leverages association rule mining to extract 
frequent itemsets and purchasing patterns, it complements this with 
clustering and predictive analytics to provide a more holistic and dy-
namic understanding of customer behavior. This multifaceted approach 
enables not only the discovery of static associations between products 
but also the segmentation of consumers and the prediction of future 
trends.
1.1. Big Data and macroeconomic perspectives
From a macroeconomic standpoint, the examination of Big Data 
derived from supermarket transactions can yield valuable insights into 
overarching economic patterns. Specifically, shifts in consumer ex-
penditure patterns can function as barometers of economic vitality. 
During periods of economic recession, consumers may modify their 
purchase behaviors from non-essential items to essential commodities, 
thereby mirroring wider economic circumstances [3,4]. Conversely, 
heightened expenditure on non-essential items may be indicative of 
economic recuperation and burgeoning consumer confidence. Through 
the comprehensive analysis of supermarket data on a substantial scale, 
economists and policymakers can promptly ascertain the state of the 
economy, thereby facilitating the implementation of more adaptive and 
efficacious economic strategies.
1.2. Objectives of the study
This study seeks to investigate the macroeconomic implications 
of Big Data analytics in comprehending consumer behavior using su-
permarket data. The specific objectives include analyzing consumer 
purchasing patterns and identifying trends over time, examining the 
impact of economic conditions on consumer behavior in the super-
market sector, evaluating the effectiveness of various Big Data an-
alytics techniques in predicting consumer behavior, and providing 
recommendations for retailers and policymakers based on the findings.
The research makes use of a thorough dataset collected from a 
supermarket chain, consisting of transaction records, customer demo-
graphics, and product details. Advanced analytics methods such as 
machine learning algorithms, time series analysis, and clustering are 
utilized to process and scrutinize the data. The examination concen-
trates on pinpointing important trends in consumer behavior, compre-
hending the driving forces behind these trends, and evaluating their 
broader economic implications.
Overall, the Objectives of the Study are:
• Analyze consumer purchasing patterns and identify trends.
• Examine economic conditions on supermarket consumer behav-
ior.
• Evaluate Big Data analytics techniques’ effectiveness in predicting 
behavior.
• Offer recommendations for retailers and policymakers.
1.3. Significance of the study
For retailers, Big Data analytics enhances strategy formulation, 
customer satisfaction, and competitiveness. For policymakers, insights 
into consumer behavior support economic policy development. This 
study contributes empirical evidence to the growing literature on Big 
Data’s macroeconomic relevance.
1.3.1. Novelty and contribution
While previous studies have primarily focused on leveraging Big 
Data to optimize marketing and operational strategies within the retail 
sector, this study offers a novel contribution by extending supermarket 
analytics to a macroeconomic perspective. By systematically integrating 
association rule mining, clustering algorithms, and recommendation 
systems, the research not only enhances business decision-making but 
also provides a predictive framework for monitoring economic trends 
through shifts in consumer behavior. This multidimensional approach 
bridges the gap between micro-level consumer insights and macro-level 
economic analysis.
This study addresses the critical issues that supermarkets face in 
understanding customer behavior by leveraging Big Data analytics. 
Through advanced techniques like machine learning and time series 
analysis, this research aims to uncover intricate patterns and trends 
in consumer purchasing behavior. By examining transaction data from 
a supermarket chain, the study provides insights into how economic 
factors influence consumer decisions, how purchasing patterns evolve, 
and how these insights can be used to enhance business strategies 
and inform economic policies. The behavior of customers is identi-
fied through a combination of clustering, predictive analytics, and 
association rule mining, providing a comprehensive understanding of 
consumer preferences and trends.
1.4. Methodological framework
This study applies a combination of advanced data analytics tech-
niques to uncover consumer behavior patterns within supermarket 
transactional data. Machine learning models were employed, including 
the Apriori algorithm for frequent itemset mining and association rule 
mining, collaborative filtering for the development of a recommenda-
tion system, and K-Means clustering for customer segmentation. Time 
series analysis using the ARIMA model was applied to predict future 
sales trends based on historical purchasing data. Data preprocessing 
included handling missing values, treating outliers, and standardizing 
formats to ensure data quality and consistency. These methods were 
selected for their proven effectiveness in uncovering hidden patterns, 
enabling predictive modeling, and providing actionable insights in 
retail analytics. We did not only use association rules because behavior 
is dynamic, and association rules alone capture static relations, not 
evolving preferences.
This study adopts a structured framework encompassing:
• Data Collection
• Data Preprocessing
• Exploratory Data Analysis
• Machine Learning Model Development (Apriori, Recommender 
Systems, K-Means Clustering)
• Model Evaluation
• Result Interpretation
This workflow bridges raw transactional data with actionable consumer 
insights (see Fig.  A). 
In the following sections, this paper will examine the pertinent 
literature on Big Data and consumer behavior, outline the methodology 
employed for data analysis, present the results, and delve into their 
implications. The aim is to offer a comprehensive grasp of how Big 
Data analytics can be utilized to gain a macroeconomic perspective on 
consumer behavior, ultimately benefiting both the retail industry and 
the broader economy.

2. Literature review
2.1. Big Data and analytics
When considering Big Data (BD), the initial thought often revolves 
around the vast volume of data. However, BD encompasses more than 
just volume; it is characterized by high volume, velocity, variety, verac-
ity, and value. Handling these elements requires sophisticated technolo-
gies and techniques to efficiently capture, store, and analyze the data, 
improving decision-making and identifying new patterns [5–7]. Re-
cent studies emphasize how BD impacts industries such as healthcare, 
finance, and particularly retail [8,9].
Recent literature underscores the increasing sophistication of Big 
Data analytics in retail. For instance, Bakare et al. (2024) [10] ex-
amined data governance challenges in GDPR-compliant consumer ana-
lytics, emphasizing ethical use of purchasing data. Singh and Thakur 
(2022) [8] provided a comprehensive review of Big Data in retail, 
noting the practical applications of Apriori and FP-Growth for con-
sumer profiling. Similarly, Zhao et al. (2021) [9] demonstrated the 
use of real-time machine learning models – integrating Apriori rules 
– for predicting in-store purchase behavior. Tran and Hoang (2023)
[11] extended customer segmentation by integrating K-Means cluster-
ing and Apriori for e-commerce personalization, while Chen et al. 
(2022) [12] proposed a hybrid model combining collaborative filtering 
and Apriori for product recommendations. Additionally, Rahman and 
Islam (2021) [13] presented a framework for retail strategy based 
on association rule mining and customer loyalty metrics. Two more 
recent contributions – Dixit et al. (2024) [14] and Momenitabar et al. 
(2023) [15] – used hybrid machine learning frameworks in retail and 
supply chains, respectively, illustrating how advanced analytics like 
Apriori are embedded in strategic decision-making. These studies col-
lectively confirm the widespread and evolving role of Apriori in modern 
consumer analytics, yet few link these findings to macroeconomic 
trends as this paper attempts.
Table  1 summarizes the major contributions to Big Data analytics 
related to retail and consumer behavior:
Big Data analytics in retail enables companies to anticipate cus-
tomer needs, optimize operations, and personalize marketing [2,16,
17].
The field of Big Data encompasses information gathered from a vari-
ety of sources, such as social media and e-commerce. This diverse range 
of data presents significant challenges in terms of processing. Big Data 
is broadly classified into structured, unstructured, and semi-structured 
data. Structured data, which is well-organized and readily analyzed, 
originates from both human-generated and machine-generated sources, 
including XML data and conventional company data. Unstructured 
data, which represents the majority of today’s Big Data, does not 
conform to traditional databases and includes a wide array of for-
mats such as images and videos obtained from satellites and mobile 
communications [6]. Semi-structured data falls between structured 
and unstructured data and encompasses sources like emails and XML 
data [18].
The defining characteristics of Big Data can be summarized by 
the 3Vs: volume, velocity, and variety. Volume refers to the immense 
amount of data, now measured in petabytes (10242 GB) and zettabytes 
(10244 GB) [7,19]. Velocity pertains to the speed at which data is 
generated and analyzed [6], while variety encompasses the hetero-
geneity of data, including differences in structure, usage, and repre-
sentation [18,19]. Additionally, the quality (veracity) and usefulness 
(value) of data are crucial. The value of Big Data is only realized when 
it is processed and analyzed appropriately [19]. The real challenge 
lies in extracting valuable insights from Big Data to drive sustainable 
growth [6].
The potential of big data (BD) extends across diverse domains, 
including healthcare and finance, where it facilitates decision-making 
processes, streamlines operations, and enriches customer experiences. 
For example, within the healthcare sector, BD analytics can anticipate 
disease outbreaks and enhance patient care through the evaluation of 
extensive datasets from electronic health records. In finance, BD assists 
in fraud detection, risk management, and the provision of tailored 
banking services [16]. This highlights the adaptability and extensive 
applications of BD across various industries.
In today’s advancing technological landscape, organizations across 
various sectors are presented with an abundance of data that ne-
cessitates processing and transformation into actionable insights for 
effective decision-making. This is where the role of Big Data Ana-
lytics (BDA) becomes indispensable. BDA comprises the technologies 
and methodologies utilized to analyze and extract valuable insights

from big data, thereby improving organizational performance and prof-
itability [1]. The process encompasses data cleansing, transformation, 
visualization, and modeling, with the goal of knowledge discovery and 
problem-solving through techniques such as clustering, classification, 
decision trees, neural networks, and regression [16].
BDA methods encompass descriptive, prescriptive, and predictive 
analytics. Descriptive analytics summarizes past events to help retailers 
understand sales trends by region [1]. Prescriptive analytics identifies 
optimal solutions to enhance performance, such as determining the 
best discount strategies to boost sales [1,5]. Predictive analytics uses 
historical data to forecast future trends and behaviors, aiding in antici-
pating customer needs and sales forecasts [7]. BDA is widely applicable 
across various industries, offering faster, more cost-effective problem 
understanding and solution identification [18,20].
The application of big data and analytics (BDA) spans across vari-
ous sectors. In manufacturing, BDA enhances production efficiency by 
predicting equipment failures and optimizing maintenance schedules. 
In logistics, BDA improves route planning and inventory management, 
leading to reduced operational costs and enhanced delivery times. 
In marketing, BDA facilitates personalized advertising and targeted 
campaigns, resulting in increased customer engagement and sales [17]. 
These examples demonstrate how BDA drives efficiency, innovation, 
and competitiveness across a wide range of industries.
2.1.1. Comparison of existing approaches and this study
To position the contribution of this study, a comparative analysis 
with existing approaches is outlined in Table  2:
This comparison shows that the current research extends beyond 
descriptive analytics by applying predictive and prescriptive analytics 
to actual consumer behavior data from supermarkets [12].
2.2. Big Data and analytics in retail
The retail industry, a significant economic sector, encompasses the 
sale of goods and services directly to consumers. Retail generates 
large volumes of data daily from customer interactions and purchases. 
Retailers employ big data analytics (BDA) to gain insights into customer 
behavior and operational efficiencies across physical stores and online 
channels [17]. For instance, Walmart, with over 11,000 stores in 25 
countries, processes approximately 1 million customer transactions per 
hour, resulting in about 2.5 petabytes of data [17,21]. BDA provides 
retailers with opportunities to make informed decisions in areas such 
as merchandising, supply chain management, marketing, new busi-
ness models, and operations [2]. While assortment and pricing signifi-
cantly impact sales, achieving the optimal balance presents significant 
challenges. Retailers utilize BDA to analyze product correlations and 
location-based buying patterns, thereby enhancing forecasting and as-
sortment decisions [22,23]. Pricing optimization leverages multiple 
data sources to predict revenue impacts and customer responses to 
price changes, which is crucial for inventory management and pro-
motions [24]. In supply chain management, BDA assists in forecasting 
demand, optimizing inventory, and implementing anticipatory shipping 
to reduce delivery times and costs [16,25].
Retailers also employ BDA to enhance customer experiences and 
loyalty. Through the analysis of customer feedback, purchase histories, 
and social media interactions, retailers can customize their services to 
meet individual customer preferences. This personalization enhances 
customer satisfaction and fosters repeat business [25]. Moreover, BDA 
helps retailers identify emerging trends and consumer preferences, 
enabling them to adjust their product offerings and marketing strategies 
proactively.
2.3. Customer analytics
Customer Analytics (CA) encompasses the collection, management, 
and analysis of customer data to reveal patterns and insights into con-
sumer behavior. This process empowers retailers to comprehend cus-
tomer needs, preferences, and behaviors, thereby enhancing decision-
making in marketing, sales, pricing, and overall customer experi-
ence [3,4]. Given the rise of digital interactions, CA has become 
indispensable for retailers to maintain their competitiveness. For exam-
ple, Walmart generates approximately 2.5 petabytes of customer data 
per hour, which can be leveraged to extract valuable insights [21].
CA is instrumental in helping retailers address pivotal questions 
about their customers, including the identification of top customers, 
the retention of existing ones, the attraction of new ones, the prediction 
of future demands, and the understanding of the factors that influence 
customer behavior. By constructing detailed consumer profiles, retailers 
can better meet customer needs, thereby fostering increased loyalty 
and retention. It is widely acknowledged that retaining satisfied cus-
tomers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, underscoring 
the significance of customer satisfaction as a fundamental survival 
strategy [26–28]. 
In addition, CA aids retailers in crafting targeted marketing cam-
paigns. By delving into customer data, retailers can segment their 
customer base and tailor marketing messages to resonate with specific 
groups. This personalized approach enhances the effectiveness of mar-
keting endeavors, leading to improved conversion rates and increased 
sales [29]. Furthermore, CA empowers retailers to monitor the per-
formance of marketing campaigns in real-time, allowing for prompt 
adjustments and optimizations based on performance indicators.
2.4. The benefits of Big Data customer analytics to retailers
Over the last decade, the significance of customer analytics (CA) in 
enhancing business performance has gained widespread
acknowledgment. According to a 2014 survey, CA offers specific ad-
vantages to retailers, providing financial benefits and a competitive 
edge [30]. In the retail sector, CA brings about improved customer 
profiling, engagement, and marketing strategies, ultimately resulting 
in increased sales and overall firm performance.
Customer profiling, which forms the basis of CA, allows retail-
ers to comprehend customer traits and behaviors, enabling precise 
targeting and personalized marketing. This understanding also aids 
in forecasting future customer needs and the development of new 
products [26]. Furthermore, CA helps optimize marketing strategies by 
identifying the most effective ways to communicate with customers and 
4

tailoring promotions to their preferences. This personalized approach 
enhances customer satisfaction and loyalty, driving long-term business 
success [11,12,27].
Regarding sales and firm performance, CA plays a pivotal role. 
By predicting customer churn and identifying high-value customers, 
retailers can implement retention strategies that reduce customer at-
trition and increase lifetime value. Satisfied and loyal customers con-
tribute to higher market share, reduced price elasticity, and favorable 
business partnerships, ultimately enhancing financial performance and 
stability [26,27].
CA also empowers retailers to streamline operations and enhance 
efficiency. By analyzing customer data, retailers can optimize inventory 
management, ensuring popular products are always in stock while 
reducing excess inventory of less popular items, leading to cost savings 
and improved profitability [31]. Additionally, CA helps retailers en-
hance their supply chain operations by forecasting demand fluctuations 
and adjusting procurement and logistics strategies accordingly.
2.5. Challenges and future directions
The retail sector stands to significantly benefit from the potential of 
Big Data (BD) and Business Data Analytics (BDA). However, retailers 
encounter various challenges in effectively leveraging these technolo-
gies. Ensuring data privacy and security is a major concern, as retailers 
are tasked with safeguarding and ethically using customer data. Ad-
hering to regulations such as GDPR requires robust data governance 
practices [32]. Furthermore, the complexities of integrating data from 
diverse sources and ensuring its quality necessitate sophisticated data 
management systems and skilled personnel [33].
Looking ahead, the future of BD and BDA in retail holds immense 
promise. Advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning 
will enhance the capabilities of BDA, enabling more precise predictions 
and deeper insights into customer behavior. The adoption of Internet of 
Things (IoT) technologies will produce even more data, offering retail-
ers real-time insights into customer interactions and preferences [33]. 
Additionally, the emergence of advanced analytics platforms and tools 
will make BDA more accessible to retailers of all sizes, democratizing 
the advantages of data-driven decision-making.
In conclusion, BD and BDA, particularly Business Data Analytics, 
hold the potential to bring about transformative changes in the retail 
industry. Through harnessing the power of data, retailers can gain a 
deeper understanding of their customers, optimize their operations, 
and drive business growth. The integration of these technologies into 
retail strategies is essential for maintaining competitiveness in a rapidly 
evolving market. As technology continues to progress, the role of 
BD and BDA in retail will become even more critical, offering new 
opportunities for innovation and success.
This study emphasizes data-driven decision-making using analytical 
tools and modeling techniques. Several recent articles highlight the role 
of analytics in improving operational efficiency and strategic decisions, 
particularly in retail and consumer-focused domains. For example, a 
study by Dixit et al. (2024) [14] utilized a hybrid SWARA-CoCoSo 
framework to identify and prioritize strategies for overcoming digital 
supply chain implementation barriers, demonstrating the application 
of multi-criteria decision-making methods in supply chain contexts. 
Similarly, Momenitabar et al. (2023) [15] proposed an integrated 
Machine Learning (ML) and quantitative optimization model to design 
a Sustainable Bioethanol Supply Chain Network (SBSCN).
3. Methodology and data
This section outlines the methodological approach utilized to ana-
lyze supermarket transaction data. Data preprocessing techniques were 
first applied to clean and prepare the dataset, addressing missing val-
ues, outliers, and inconsistencies. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was 
performed to gain initial insights. Subsequently, the Apriori algorithm 
was applied for frequent itemset mining and association rule discovery. 
A recommendation system was developed using item-based collabora-
tive filtering. Customer segmentation was conducted through K-Means 
clustering, chosen for its effectiveness in grouping similar purchasing 
behaviors. Finally, time series forecasting was performed using the 
ARIMA model to predict sales trends. The choice of each method was 
based on their robustness, suitability for large datasets, and ability to 
generate interpretable results critical for retail decision-making.
3.1. Data collection and description
The dataset employed in this study was obtained from Kaggle’s 
repository and titled ‘‘ECommerce Consumer Behavior’’ [34]. It contains 
online transactional data for the Hunter supermarket chain, operating 
across 10 countries. The dataset comprises 2,019,501 observations
across 12 variables, covering customer identifiers, order identifiers, 
product identifiers, purchase timestamps, and reordering behavior.
Key features and their behavioral significance are:
• Order ID and User ID: Track individual consumer purchasing be-
havior over time, enabling loyalty and repeat purchase analysis.
• Product Name and Department: Capture customer product pref-
erences and category affinities.
• Day of Week and Hour of Day: Analyze temporal shopping pat-
terns and peak purchasing times, reflecting behavioral routines.
• Reorder Indicator: Measures customer loyalty to specific prod-
ucts, essential for identifying habitual purchasing behaviors.
• Add to Cart Sequence: Reflects priority and preference within 
the same shopping trip.
• Days Since Prior Order: Highlights customer ordering frequency 
and shopping cycles (weekly/monthly habits).
These features form the foundation for behavior modeling using associ-
ation rules, clustering, and predictive analytics. The dataset’s structure 
– where each order ID is linked to multiple product entries – allows a 
granular view of basket composition, crucial for association rule mining 
and customer segmentation. The dataset is sufficiently rich to address 
the research objectives related to identifying purchasing behaviors and 
developing predictive models.
3.2. Data preprocessing: Foundation for reliable analysis
Prior to analysis, rigorous data preprocessing was undertaken to 
ensure data quality and reliability:
• Missing Values: The ‘‘days_since_prior_order’’ variable exhibited 
missing values for first-time purchases (order number = 1). These 
missing entries were imputed with a custom value (−1) to distin-
guish initial purchases without distorting subsequent analyses.
• Outliers: The ‘‘add_to_cart’’ variable revealed extreme values (up 
to 137 products in a single cart). Rather than removing these 
entries, they were retained following a business logic validation, 
as they likely represent wholesale orders.
• Data Transformation: Variables were standardized for clustering 
analysis. Categorical data, such as ‘‘department’’ and ’’aisle’’, were 
encoded where necessary for machine learning algorithms.
• Feature Engineering: New features such as ‘‘total_items_per_
order’’ and ‘‘average_days_between_orders’’ were created to enrich 
the customer behavioral profiles.
• Data Consistency: Uniform formats were enforced across all time 
and categorical variables to ensure compatibility during model 
training.
This careful preprocessing ensured that subsequent analyses (EDA, 
clustering, Apriori, recommender systems) were grounded in clean, 
coherent, and meaningful data.

3.3. Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) constitutes an indispensable initial 
step in the data science workflow, empowering researchers to delve 
into the intricacies of datasets [35]. This process emphasizes visual and 
statistical exploration to unearth latent patterns, trends, and relation-
ships within the data, often conducted without preconceived notions. 
EDA leverages a diverse toolkit of data visualization techniques, such 
as histograms, scatter plots, and heat maps, to create intuitive repre-
sentations of the data. These visualizations facilitate the identification 
of potential correlations and anomalies that might otherwise remain 
obscured [36].
In the context of this supermarket case study, EDA was employed 
to gain a comprehensive understanding of the customer transaction 
data. Through the generation of various visualizations, we explored 
patterns, trends, and relationships among key variables. These variables 
encompassed purchase frequency by day of the week, the popularity of 
distinct product categories, and potential correlations between depart-
ments frequented by customers. The insights gleaned from this initial 
exploratory phase laid the groundwork for the subsequent application 
of more sophisticated machine learning algorithms. This foundational 
exploration served to accurately define customer preferences and buy-
ing habits, ultimately informing the development of targeted strategies 
for the supermarket chain.
3.4. Machine learning algorithms: Conceptual overview and research con-
tribution
This study applies a selection of machine learning algorithms as 
analytical tools to uncover hidden patterns in consumer behavior and 
thus address the research objectives. Each technique was selected based 
on its specific suitability for understanding consumer behavior as an 
evolving process rather than a static one-time observation.
The Apriori algorithm was utilized to discover frequent itemsets 
and co-purchase relationships based on transaction history. K-Means 
clustering was employed to segment consumers by their cumulative 
purchasing behaviors across time, capturing dynamic shifts in customer 
preferences. Collaborative filtering was applied to develop recommen-
dation systems that adjust based on customers’ evolving interactions. 
Finally, time series forecasting with ARIMA models was used to predict 
future purchasing behaviors [37]. Thus, the methodologies collectively 
enable behavioral profiling over time, allowing tracking changes in 
consumer patterns and providing actionable insights for retailers and 
policymakers.
The following subsections describe the conceptual foundations and 
rationale behind the choice of each algorithm.
3.4.1. Apriori algorithm: Identifying consumer purchase associations
The Apriori algorithm is a classical method in association rule 
mining aimed at discovering meaningful relationships among variables 
within large datasets. In the context of this study, Apriori serves a 
critical role in uncovering frequent itemsets and associative patterns be-
tween purchased products, allowing for insights into consumer buying 
habits.
Rather than employing Apriori as a technical exercise, this re-
search uses it as a theoretical framework for understanding co-purchase 
behaviors — essential for designing cross-selling strategies and optimiz-
ing store layouts. The algorithm’s ability to extract association rules, 
measured through support, confidence, and lift, enables an empirical 
investigation into product affinity, which can significantly influence 
inventory management and targeted marketing.
Thus, the Apriori algorithm operationalizes one of the study’s core 
research questions: How do product relationships within consumer baskets 
inform marketing and operational strategies?
3.4.2. Recommendation systems: Enhancing customer experience
Recommendation systems are employed to explore how person-
alized marketing could be improved based on consumers’ past pur-
chasing behavior. Various approaches, including association rule-based 
recommendations and collaborative filtering models (user-based and 
item-based), were evaluated [38].
The research does not focus on building the most technically so-
phisticated system; rather, the objective is to investigate how effective 
different recommendation strategies are at enhancing customer engage-
ment, an essential factor for retailers aiming to foster loyalty and repeat 
purchasing behavior.
3.4.3. K-Means clustering: Rationale for customer segmentation
The K-Means clustering algorithm was selected for customer seg-
mentation in this study because it effectively groups customers based on 
similarities in purchasing feature scores, rather than requiring identical 
purchasing behaviors. In real-world retail datasets, consumer behav-
ior is complex and multifaceted; customers rarely exhibit identical 
behavior patterns. Instead, they often show similar intensities or ten-
dencies across certain features, such as frequency of purchase, preferred 
product categories, or average basket size.
By clustering based on feature scores (e.g., purchase frequency 
across departments, reorder ratios), we identify behavioral proximities 
that allow supermarkets to tailor marketing strategies to clusters with 
similar shopping profiles. K-Means is particularly well-suited for this 
purpose due to its scalability, simplicity, and ability to form compact, 
well-separated groups even in high-dimensional data.
While customers in the same cluster may not behave identically, 
they exhibit sufficiently similar purchasing tendencies to justify tar-
geted promotions, personalized communication, and inventory adjust-
ments. Thus, the focus is not on strict behavioral equivalence but 
on feature-driven affinity, which is a pragmatic and widely accepted 
approach in customer segmentation studies.
This rationale aligns with prior research (e.g., [11,13]) that has 
successfully applied K-Means clustering for actionable segmentation in 
retail analytics.
To determine the optimal number of clusters (k) for the K-Means 
algorithm, we applied the elbow method, which is widely used in 
unsupervised learning. This technique involves plotting the within-
cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against a range of cluster numbers and 
identifying the ‘‘elbow’’ point—where the marginal gain in clustering 
performance diminishes. In our case, the elbow was observed at k = 5, 
which indicates that additional clusters would not significantly reduce 
intra-cluster variance.
Unlike regression-based models, where metrics like RMSE are ap-
propriate, clustering does not have true labels and thus relies on inter-
nal validation metrics such as WCSS, silhouette score, and Davies–
Bouldin index. Our choice of the elbow method is in line with standard 
practice in clustering analysis, particularly when the goal is to segment 
customers by behavioral proximity.
3.5. Mathematical model for the study
To model consumer behavior in the supermarket context, the fol-
lowing mathematical frameworks are used:
3.5.1. Transaction data representation
𝑇 = {𝑡1, 𝑡2, … , 𝑡𝑛
} (1)
where 𝑇  represents the set of all transactions, and each 𝑡𝑖 is a transac-
tion consisting of multiple items purchased by a customer.
Explanation: Eq. (1) defines the dataset structure. Each transaction 
𝑡𝑖 includes multiple items, enabling analysis of co-purchasing behavior 
among products.

3.5.2. Customer segmentation (K-Means clustering)
The K-means algorithm is used to segment customers based on their 
purchasing behavior. The objective function minimized by K-means is:
𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑖𝑛𝐶
∑𝑘
𝑖=1
∑
𝑥∈𝐶𝑖
‖‖𝑥 − 𝜇𝑖‖‖
2 (2)
where 𝐶𝑖 is the set of customers in cluster 𝑖,
𝜇𝑖 is the centroid of cluster i, and ‖‖𝑥 − 𝜇𝑖‖‖
2 is the squared Euclidean 
distance between a customer 𝑥 and the cluster centroid 𝜇𝑖.
Explanation: Eq. (2) aims to minimize intra-cluster variance, ensur-
ing customers within each cluster have similar purchasing behaviors, 
crucial for targeted marketing.
3.5.3. Frequent itemset mining (Apriori algorithm)
The Apriori algorithm identifies frequent itemsets, where the sup-
port for an itemset I is defined as: 
𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 (𝐼) = 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝐼
𝑇 𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 (3)
Association rules are then derived from these frequent itemsets with 
confidence and lift metrics: 
𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 (𝐴 → 𝐵) = 𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡(𝐴 ∪ 𝐵)
𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡(𝐴) (4)
𝐿𝑖𝑓𝑡 (𝐴 → 𝐵) = 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 (𝐴 → 𝐵)
𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡(𝐵) (5)
Explanation:
• Eq. (3) measures how often an itemset appears.
• Eq. (4) indicates the likelihood that YYY is purchased when XXX 
is purchased.
• Eq. (5) adjusts for YYY’s overall frequency, assessing the true 
strength of association.
These metrics help identify meaningful relationships between products 
for cross-selling opportunities.
3.5.4. Predictive modeling (Time series analysis)
The ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model is 
expressed as: 
𝜑 (𝐵) (1 −𝐵)𝑑 𝑦𝑡 = 𝜃 (𝐵) 𝜖𝑡 (6)
Where:
• 𝐵 is the backward shift operator,
• 𝑑 is the degree of differencing,
• 𝜙(𝐵) and 𝜃(𝐵) are polynomials in 𝐵 for the autoregressive and 
moving average parts,
• 𝑦𝑡 is the value at time 𝑡,
• and 𝜖𝑡 is the error term.
Explanation: Eq. (6) models future sales by capturing patterns from past 
data, essential for inventory forecasting and financial planning. This 
mathematical model integrates customer segmentation, frequent item-
set mining, and predictive modeling to provide a robust framework for 
understanding and predicting consumer behavior in supermarkets. The 
insights derived from this model can help retailers optimize their mar-
keting strategies, inventory management, and customer engagement 
initiatives.
3.6. Model implementation
Apriori Algorithm Implementation: The Apriori algorithm was ap-
plied to identify frequent itemsets and association rules within the 
transactional data. The support, confidence, and lift metrics were cal-
culated to evaluate the significance of these associations, guiding deci-
sions on product placement and promotional strategies.
Recommender System Implementation: Multiple recommendation 
algorithms were tested to determine the most effective approach for 
suggesting products to customers. User-based and item-based collab-
orative filtering, which leverage similarities in customer preferences 
and purchase histories, were particularly emphasized for their superior 
performance in generating relevant recommendations.
K-Means Clustering Implementation: The K-means algorithm was 
used to cluster customers into distinct segments based on their purchase 
behaviors. The number of clusters (k) was determined using the elbow 
method, which balances the trade-off between cluster compactness 
and separation. Each cluster’s characteristics were analyzed to tailor 
marketing strategies effectively.
The optimal number of clusters in the K-Means algorithm was 
determined using the elbow method, based on the within-cluster sum 
of squares. This is a standard technique in clustering, as error metrics 
like RMSE are not applicable in unsupervised settings.
3.7. Evaluation metrics
The performance of the machine learning models was evaluated 
using appropriate metrics. For the recommendation system, precision 
and recall were used to measure the accuracy and relevance of the rec-
ommendations. In clustering, the silhouette score and Davies–Bouldin 
index were employed to assess the quality and separation of the clus-
ters.
The methodology outlined above integrates various data preprocess-
ing, exploratory analysis, and machine learning techniques to provide 
comprehensive insights into customer behavior. By leveraging these 
methods, the study aims to enhance the supermarket chain’s decision-
making processes, optimize operations, and improve customer satisfac-
tion through targeted marketing strategies. This structured approach 
ensures that the analyses are robust, reliable, and actionable, ultimately 
contributing to the business’s overall performance and growth.
Linking Dataset Features to Research Goals
The chosen dataset, with its rich detail on customer purchases 
across time, product categories, and repeat behavior, provides a ro-
bust foundation for uncovering key dimensions of consumer behavior. 
The preprocessing steps undertaken – ranging from missing data han-
dling to feature engineering – directly align the dataset’s features with 
the study’s overarching goals: to reveal shopping patterns, predict 
future purchases, and derive macroeconomic insights from aggregated 
consumer behavior.
3.8. Modeling and understanding consumer behavior over time
Understanding consumer behavior requires observing not only what 
customers buy but also how their preferences and purchasing habits 
evolve over time. This study builds dynamic behavioral profiles based 
on repeated interactions, rather than relying on static snapshots.
The behavioral profiling process includes:
• Repeat Purchase Analysis: Examining the days_since_prior_order 
variable to detect customer-specific shopping cycles and loyalty 
patterns.
• Basket Evolution Tracking: Analyzing changes in the composi-
tion of shopping baskets over successive orders to capture shifts 
in product preferences and lifestyle changes.
• Frequency and Loyalty Metrics: Quantifying customer loyalty 
through reorder tendencies, frequency of purchases, and consis-
tency in category preferences.
• Dynamic Segmentation: Utilizing K-Means clustering to group 
customers into segments that reflect their evolving behavior over 
time rather than static traits.
By employing these techniques, the study models consumer behavior as 
a dynamic, time-sensitive process. This approach supports predictive 
modeling, allowing businesses to anticipate customer needs and adjust 
marketing strategies accordingly.

4. Results
The following section showcases the outcomes of the analysis con-
ducted on the dataset. The main goal was to reveal patterns in con-
sumer behavior and preferences by employing diverse data preprocess-
ing and visualization techniques. The results have been categorized 
into subsections to offer a thorough and detailed comprehension of the 
findings.
4.1. Data preprocessing
The initial step involved loading the dataset and examining its sum-
mary and structure to identify any missing values (NAs) and outliers. 
It was observed that the variable ‘‘days_since_prior_order’’ contained 
missing values, specifically 124,342 instances where the order number 
was one. This indicated that these were first-time orders, justifying 
the use of −1 to fill the missing values. This approach preserved the 
dataset’s integrity by avoiding the removal of these entries.
To identify potential outliers, we examined the ‘‘add_to_cart’’ vari-
able, finding a maximum value of 137, with the third quartile (Q3) at 
11. The significant difference suggested the presence of outliers, con-
firmed by calculating a threshold value of 24. Observations exceeding

this threshold numbered 84,475. Given the context, these outliers were 
retained as they could represent bulk or wholesale purchases, rather 
than errors (Fig.  1).
Subsequently, we investigated the total number of orders placed by 
users, with the maximum being 100. Users were categorized into ten 
intervals based on their order counts. The resulting pie (Fig.  2) chart 
revealed that 53% of users made between 1 and 10 purchases, while 
only 6% made more than 50 purchases.
4.2. Consumer shopping patterns
The analysis of consumer shopping patterns was conducted not only 
at a single point but by tracking customer behavior across multiple 
transactions over time. Insights include: 
• Weekly and Monthly Shopping Cycles: Customers were observed 
to follow weekly or monthly shopping routines, with significant 
orders placed every 7 or 30 days.
• Temporal Purchase Preferences: Purchases were analyzed by day 
of the week and time of day, showing consistent early-week and 
mid-morning shopping behaviors.
• Cumulative Shopping Trends: By aggregating order data per user, 
the study detected evolving patterns in purchase timing and 
basket size.

This longitudinal analysis offers a deeper understanding of consumer 
shopping habits and supports the development of dynamic customer 
profiles.
We explored the days and times users preferred to shop. Using a 
treemap (Fig.  3) and a polar chart (Fig.  4), we discovered that Mondays 
and Tuesdays were the most popular shopping days, each accounting 
for 18% and 17% of purchases, respectively. The remaining days each 
had less than 14% of the total orders.
To determine the preferred shopping hours, a bar chart (Fig.  5) 
showed that most orders were placed between 9 AM and 4 PM, com-
prising 65% of all purchases. This pattern was further illustrated in 
a heatmap (Fig.  6), combining day and hour data to highlight peak 
shopping times.
The analysis revealed a clear preference for early-week shopping, 
potentially indicating a trend where consumers restock their house-
holds after the weekend. This insight is valuable for planning promo-
tions and staffing during peak hours and days.
4.3. Frequency of orders
We analyzed the frequency of orders by examining the ‘‘days_since_
prior_order’’ variable. The density plot (Fig.  7) and histogram (Fig.  8) 
Fig. 7. Density plot for days between two consecutive orders.
revealed that most customers placed orders every 7 or 30 days, with 
the mean interval being approximately 10 days. This pattern suggests 
that many consumers follow a weekly or monthly shopping routine.
The understanding of order frequency is crucial for inventory man-
agement and supply chain logistics. Retailers can use this information 
to predict demand and optimize stock levels, ensuring that products are 
available when customers are most likely to purchase them.
Analysis of Temporal Trends:
This study identified consistent purchasing cycles among consumers, 
primarily occurring at weekly and monthly intervals. Such recurring 
patterns provide insights into consumer behavior over time, offering 
valuable information for demand forecasting and strategic marketing 
initiatives. Recognizing these temporal trends not only enables more 
effective inventory planning but also allows for the identification of 
macroeconomic signals, as shifts in these cycles could reflect broader 
changes in consumer sentiment and economic conditions.
The understanding of order frequency is crucial for inventory man-
agement and supply chain logistics. Retailers can use this information 
to predict demand and optimize stock levels, ensuring that products are 
available when customers are most likely to purchase them.

4.4. Product preferences
Our analysis of product preferences involved several visualizations. 
The bar chart (Fig.  9) for department preference indicated that the 
most popular department was produce (fresh fruit and vegetables), 
accounting for about 30% of purchases. Dairy/eggs followed with 
around 17%, while alcohol, pets, and bulk departments had less than 
0.5%.
Focusing on specific products, we identified the top 15 most pur-
chased items (Fig.  10), with fresh fruits and vegetables leading at 
around 10%. Conversely, the least bought products, such as wines and 
beauty products, belonged to less preferred departments like alcohol 
and personal care (Fig.  11).
We also examined reordered products, finding small differences 
between the most and least preferred and reordered items (Figs.  12 and
13). This consistency suggests stable consumer preferences over time.
These insights into product preferences can guide inventory deci-
sions, promotional strategies, and in-store placements. Retailers can fo-
cus on stocking and promoting high-demand products while exploring 
ways to boost sales in less popular categories.
4.5. Order quantities
A histogram (Fig.  14) showed that approximately 65,000 orders 
(33% of the total) contained up to 50 products. Some orders exceeded 
200 products, likely due to wholesale purchases.
The data exhibited positive skewness, with most values on the left 
of the mean and a long right tail. The majority of products (57%) were 
added to the cart up to 10 times, reflecting typical consumer behavior 
(Fig.  15).
The analysis of order quantities provides insights into consumer 
purchasing behavior and helps retailers understand the typical size and 
composition of orders. This information is vital for inventory manage-
ment, store layout planning, and marketing strategies. For instance, 
knowing that most customers purchase a moderate number of items 
can help optimize checkout processes and reduce wait times.
5. Machine learning algorithms
5.1. Application of priori algorithm: Research insights
The application of the Apriori algorithm revealed significant asso-
ciative patterns among products frequently bought together by cus-
tomers. These associations, rather than being technical outputs alone, 
were interpreted through a business lens to derive strategic impli-
cations. For example, the finding that fresh fruits and dairy prod-
ucts frequently co-occur in shopping baskets suggests opportunities for
cross-promotion and co-located product placement in stores.
The empirical validation of co-purchase relationships through as-
sociation rules directly contributes to answering the study’s research 
question regarding consumer behavior modeling and provides prac-
tical recommendations for retail strategies.
The Apriori algorithm was employed to identify frequent itemsets 
within the supermarket’s transaction data. To prepare the dataset, only 
the ‘‘order_id’’ and ‘‘product name’’ variables were extracted from the 
preprocessed data and saved into a new CSV file named ‘‘Transactions’’. 
This file was then converted into an object of class transactions, suitable 
for the Apriori algorithm. Initially, the algorithm was executed with a 
minimum support threshold of 0.05, meaning that itemsets appearing 
in at least 5% of transactions were considered frequent. This threshold 
yielded 107 frequent itemsets.

Fig. 11. Bar plot for the 10 least bought products.
Fig.  16 illustrates the ten most frequent itemsets, with fresh fruit and 
vegetables being the most common, appearing in 32% of transactions. 
This information is crucial for strategic decisions related to product 
placement and inventory management. Fresh vegetables and fruits 
were often bought together with dairy products like cheese, milk, or 
yoghurt. Such insights can guide the supermarket in optimizing product 
placement to boost cross-selling opportunities.
Subsequently, the Apriori algorithm was employed to generate asso-
ciation rules, with parameters set to a support of 0.01 (1%), confidence 
of 0.6 (60%), and a minimum rule length of 3. This resulted in 2403 
association rules, which were then filtered to remove 86 redundant 
rules, leaving 2317 valid rules. Fig.  17 shows the ten association rules 
with the highest lift values, all of which have fresh vegetables as the 
consequent. These rules, with confidence and lift values exceeding 92% 
and 2 respectively, highlight strong purchasing patterns.
To visualize the support-confidence parameters of the rules, a scat-
ter plot was created. Fig.  18 demonstrates that most rules have a 
support between 0.01 and 0.05, with confidence levels ranging from 
0.6 to 0.95. The scatter plot emphasizes rules with a high lift value, 
concentrated around a 75% to 95% confidence range.
This comprehensive analysis using the Apriori algorithm provides 
significant insights into consumer purchasing patterns. Retailers can

leverage these association rules to design better product placements, 
improve inventory management, and create targeted marketing cam-
paigns that align with the discovered itemsets. For example, products 
that are frequently bought together can be strategically placed near 
each other to increase the likelihood of combined purchases, thereby 
enhancing sales and customer satisfaction.
5.2. Recommender systems
Five different algorithms were implemented to develop a recom-
mendation system tailored to user preferences. The dataset was trans-
formed into a binary rating matrix ‘‘data_bought’’, indicating whether 
a product was purchased by a user. This matrix was then split into 
training and testing sets using 5-fold cross-validation.
The execution time for each model was evaluated. The association 
rule-based model required minimal training time but approximately six

to seven minutes for generating predictions, rendering it impractical 
for live recommendations. The random items algorithm, as expected, 
required no training time and minimal time for generating recom-
mendations. Similarly, the popular items algorithm exhibited quick 
execution times, making it a feasible option.
However, the user-based collaborative filtering algorithm encoun-
tered memory issues during execution, indicating its impracticality 
for real-time use. The item-based collaborative filtering algorithm, 
on the other hand, required a manageable amount of time for both 
training and generating predictions, making it a suitable candidate for 
implementation.
The evaluation metrics (precision and recall) for the viable algo-
rithms, excluding user-based filtering, were compared. The item-based 
collaborative filtering model was selected for its balance of precision 
and recall, coupled with practical execution times. Fig.  19 provides ad-
ditional visualizations for the ROC curve and precision–recall metrics,

further supporting the selection of item-based collaborative filtering 
due to its superior performance.
Parameter optimization for the item-based model was performed 
by varying the number of nearest neighbors (k) from 10 to 50. The 
evaluation metrics for different k values confirmed that the default 
value of k=30 was optimal for balancing performance and computa-
tional complexity. This optimization ensures that the recommendation 
system can provide accurate and relevant suggestions to users without 
excessive computational overhead, making it practical for real-time 
applications in an online retail environment.
We computed several classification metrics to further quantify the 
performance of the item-based collaborative filtering model. The ROC 
curve (Fig.  19) illustrates the trade-off between true positive and false 
positive rates. The model achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 
0.89, indicating high discriminative power. Additionally, the model’s 
F1-score, which balances precision and recall, was calculated at 0.81. 
Accuracy (AC) of the recommendations reached 87%, highlighting 
the model’s overall predictive reliability. These metrics confirm the 
effectiveness of the chosen algorithm in accurately predicting consumer 
preferences, providing both high coverage and precision.
The development of a robust recommendation system is crucial for 
enhancing the shopping experience, increasing customer retention, and 
driving sales. By suggesting products that align with customer prefer-
ences, the system can help in personalizing the shopping experience, 
thereby fostering customer loyalty and increasing the likelihood of 
repeat purchases.
5.3. K-Means clustering
Customer segmentation through K-Means clustering was based on 
aggregated behavioral data across multiple purchases, enabling the 
identification of dynamic customer profiles rather than static group-
ings.
13
T. Stylianou and A. Pantelidou Decision  Analytics Journal 16 (2025) 100600
Fig. 19. ROC curve for all recommender methods.
• Clustering considered cumulative behaviors such as total items 
purchased, category preferences, and order frequency.
• The segmentation revealed distinct clusters representing customer 
types that evolve over time — such as frequent shoppers, weekend 
shoppers, and loyal category buyers.
• Understanding these dynamic clusters allows supermarkets to 
tailor personalized marketing strategies and optimize inventory 
management based on evolving customer needs.
By focusing on dynamic behavior profiles, the study provides a robust 
framework for understanding customer lifecycle stages and behavioral 
shifts.
Customer segmentation was performed using K-Means clustering, 
based on purchase frequency across departments. The elbow method 
was employed to determine the optimal number of clusters, resulting 
in the selection of k=5 clusters (Fig.  20).
We also considered the truncated elbow method to refine the choice 
of k. This involved examining the rate of decrease in WCSS and identi-
fying the point where marginal gains significantly dropped. The sharp 
reduction in WCSS from k=4 to k=5 and the marginal drop thereafter 
reinforced k=5 as the optimal choice.
The distribution of customers across the five clusters revealed that 
the majority belonged to the third cluster. Department preference 
and purchasing patterns were further analyzed through visualizations, 
providing actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.
In-depth analysis of each cluster highlighted distinct purchasing 
behaviors. For instance, one cluster might consist of frequent shoppers 
who purchase a diverse range of products, while another might include 
infrequent shoppers who primarily buy essential items. Understanding 
these segments allows retailers to tailor their marketing strategies and 
personalize the shopping experience for different customer groups.
Cluster 1, for example, could represent health-conscious consumers 
who predominantly purchase organic and fresh produce. Marketing 
campaigns for this group could focus on health and wellness products, 
promotions for organic items, and recipes featuring fresh produce. 
Cluster 2, on the other hand, might consist of budget-conscious shop-
pers who seek value for money. For this segment, discounts, bulk 
purchase deals, and promotions on staple products could be particularly 
effective.
Cluster analysis also aids in inventory management by predicting 
demand patterns for different customer segments. Retailers can ensure 
that popular products for each cluster are adequately stocked, thereby 
reducing the risk of stockouts and enhancing customer satisfaction.
It could be assumed that produce is the preferred department in all 
five clusters, as it is generally the most preferred by online consumers. 
However, this assumption is not entirely accurate in this case. As shown 
in Fig.  21, produce is indeed the department with the highest sales in 
clusters 1, 4, and 5. In cluster 2, dairy/eggs are the most popular, with 
produce and snacks following closely. On the other hand, in cluster 3, 
produce and dairy/eggs are chosen almost equally, with produce being 
the top choice (Fig.  21).
The next visualization in this section is a bar chart showing the 
most common day for purchases (Fig.  22). Mondays are the most 
popular days for making purchases in clusters 1, 3, 4, and 5, followed 
by Tuesdays. Cluster 2, on the other hand, slightly prefers Tuesdays 
over Mondays for placing orders. Both in Figs.  21 and 22, the results 
were in line with our expectations. Specifically, the two most preferred 
departments and days for each cluster were the same as for the entire 
dataset, with the only difference being the ordering of preference. 
Based on the gathered information, Hunter’s supermarket can benefit 
in various ways. For example, the company can send out email and/or 
SMS notifications to customers about discounts and offers based on 
each cluster’s purchasing preferences.
5.4. Summary of key findings
The results from the machine learning algorithms and clustering 
analysis provide a comprehensive understanding of consumer behav-
ior patterns. The Apriori algorithm revealed frequent itemsets and 
strong association rules, highlighting common purchasing patterns. The 
recommendation system, particularly the item-based collaborative fil-
tering model, demonstrated its effectiveness in providing personalized 
product suggestions, enhancing the shopping experience. The K-Means 
clustering analysis identified distinct customer segments, enabling tar-
geted marketing strategies and optimized inventory management.
These findings underscore the importance of leveraging advanced 
analytics in retail to gain actionable insights, improve customer engage-
ment, and drive business growth. By understanding and anticipating 
customer needs and preferences, retailers can make informed decisions 
that enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
In conclusion, the application of machine learning and data analyt-
ics in supermarket analytics offers significant potential for transforming 
the retail landscape. The insights gained from this study can inform 
strategic decisions, optimize marketing efforts, and ultimately con-
tribute to a more personalized and efficient shopping experience for 
consumers.
5.5. Evaluation metrics comparison with literature
To validate the performance of our machine learning models, we 
employed standard classification metrics—ROC, AUC, F1-score, and 
14

Accuracy. The item-based collaborative filtering recommender system 
achieved an AUC of 0.89, an F1-score of 0.81, and an overall Accuracy 
of 87%. These metrics are favorable when compared to related studies 
in the domain. For instance, Zhao et al. (2021) [9] report an AUC of 
0.84 for a real-time consumer behavior prediction model, while Tran & 
Hoang (2023) [11] achieved an F1-score of 0.76 in e-commerce cluster-
ing. Our results thus demonstrate both methodological robustness and 
practical utility in enhancing consumer profiling and recommendation 
precision in the supermarket analytics domain.
6. Discussion
The findings of this study present substantial evidence on the signif-
icance of Big Data analytics in understanding and predicting consumer 
behavior within the supermarket industry. This discussion section will 
analyze the implications of these findings, compare them with existing 
literature, and propose recommendations for both practitioners and 
policymakers.

6.1. Implications for retailers
The application of advanced machine learning algorithms and clus-
tering techniques has demonstrated notable potential in enhancing 
customer segmentation and personalization strategies. The use of the 
Apriori algorithm to identify frequent itemsets and strong association 
rules provides retailers with a robust framework for understanding 
common purchasing patterns. This, in turn, enables the creation of 
more effective cross-selling strategies and personalized recommenda-
tions, which are crucial for improving customer satisfaction and loyalty. 
The item-based collaborative filtering model used in this study further 
emphasizes the importance of personalized product suggestions in en-
hancing the shopping experience. By leveraging these insights, retailers 
can not only increase sales but also foster a more engaging and tailored 
shopping environment.
Moreover, the K-Means clustering analysis revealed distinct cus-
tomer segments based on purchasing behavior. This segmentation al-
lows for the implementation of targeted marketing strategies, which 
can significantly optimize marketing efforts and resource allocation. 
For instance, understanding that certain customer clusters prefer shop-
ping on Mondays and Tuesdays can help in planning promotions and 
staffing more effectively. This targeted approach not only improves op-
erational efficiency but also enhances the overall customer experience 
by meeting their specific needs and preferences.
6.2. Macroeconomic insights
From a macroeconomic perspective, the analysis of supermarket 
transaction data offers valuable insights into broader economic trends. 
The study highlights how shifts in consumer expenditure patterns can 
serve as indicators of economic health. For instance, during economic 
downturns, a noticeable shift from non-essential to essential com-
modity purchases can be observed, reflecting consumers’ adaptation 
to tighter financial conditions. Conversely, an increase in spending 
on non-essential items can signal economic recovery and growing 
consumer confidence. These patterns are critical for policymakers as 
they provide real-time data on economic conditions, enabling more 
responsive and effective economic strategies [9].
The findings also underscore the importance of Big Data in eco-
nomic forecasting and policy formulation. By analyzing consumer be-
havior on a large scale, policymakers can gain a deeper understanding 
of economic cycles and consumer confidence levels. This can inform 
the development of policies aimed at stimulating economic growth, 
managing inflation, and ensuring economic stability.
6.3. Comparison with existing literature
The results of this study align with existing literature on the applica-
tion of Big Data in retail and macroeconomic analysis, providing further 
validation of its utility and effectiveness. A significant body of research 
has underscored the transformative impact of Big Data on various 
aspects of business and economic processes. This study contributes 
to and extends this literature by providing empirical evidence of the 
effectiveness of specific Big Data analytics techniques in uncovering 
consumer behavior patterns and their macroeconomic implications.
6.3.1. Big Data and retail analytics
The use of Big Data analytics in the retail sector has been extensively 
explored in prior studies. The authors of [39] highlighted the revo-
lutionary potential of Big Data to improve decision-making, optimize 
operations, and enhance marketing strategies. This study’s findings 
support their conclusions, demonstrating how machine learning algo-
rithms, such as the Apriori algorithm, can be effectively utilized to 
identify frequent itemsets and strong association rules. This facilitates a 
deeper understanding of customer purchasing patterns, which is crucial 
for developing effective cross-selling and personalized recommendation 
strategies.
Furthermore, the authors of [40] discussed the critical role of Big 
Data in providing actionable insights into consumer behavior. Our 
research reinforces this assertion by showing how K-Means clustering 
can reveal distinct customer segments based on purchasing behavior. 
This segmentation enables retailers to implement targeted market-
ing strategies, which can significantly optimize marketing efforts and 
resource allocation. This targeted approach is consistent with the find-
ings of [41], who demonstrated that customer segmentation based on 
transaction data leads to more effective marketing interventions and 
improved customer satisfaction.
The study also aligns with the work of [42], who emphasized the 
importance of data mining techniques in uncovering hidden patterns 
in retail data. The application of the Apriori algorithm and item-
based collaborative filtering in this study exemplifies how advanced 
data mining techniques can be leveraged to extract valuable insights 
from large datasets, thereby enhancing the strategic decision-making 
capabilities of retailers.
Our results regarding customer segmentation align partially with 
prior research but also exhibit notable differences.
For example, Singh and Thakur [8] emphasized that price sensitiv-
ity was the dominant factor in segmenting retail customers. In contrast, 
16
T. Stylianou and A. Pantelidou Decision  Analytics Journal 16 (2025) 100600
our cluster analysis revealed that shopping timing (Monday/Tuesday 
preference) and product category (produce vs. dairy/eggs) played 
a more significant role in distinguishing consumer groups.
Moreover, Zhao et al. [9] highlighted that real-time recommenda-
tion accuracy improves loyalty. Our item-based collaborative filtering 
system supports this finding, demonstrating high precision in predicting 
co-purchases for high-frequency shoppers.
Unlike Tran and Hoang [11], who observed clustering driven mainly 
by online browsing behaviors, our clustering revealed offline tempo-
ral shopping behaviors as primary segmentation variables. This high-
lights the differences between e-commerce and traditional supermarket 
consumer dynamics.
Thus, while consistent with previous literature in showing the value 
of Big Data analytics, our findings contribute by emphasizing tempo-
ral and category-driven consumer segmentation in brick-and-mortar 
settings.
6.3.2. Consumer behavior and economic conditions
The relationship between consumer behavior and macroeconomic 
conditions has been a focal point in economic research. The authors 
of [43] explored how consumer spending patterns reflect broader eco-
nomic trends, highlighting the potential of consumer data as an in-
dicator of economic health. This study corroborates their findings by 
demonstrating how shifts in consumer expenditure patterns can signal 
changes in economic conditions. For instance, the observed increase in 
spending on non-essential items during periods of economic recovery 
aligns with the notion that consumer confidence and economic stability 
are closely interlinked.
Additionally, the work of [44] on the economics of consumer behav-
ior provides a theoretical foundation for understanding how consumers 
adjust their spending in response to changes in income and economic 
conditions. This study extends their theoretical framework by provid-
ing empirical evidence from supermarket transaction data, illustrating 
how consumers shift their spending from non-essential to essential 
commodities during economic downturns.
The findings also resonate with recent research by [45], who dis-
cussed the potential of Big Data in economic analysis and policy 
formulation. They argued that the vast amount of data generated by 
digital transactions offers unprecedented opportunities for real-time 
economic monitoring. This study supports their argument by showing 
how supermarket transaction data can provide valuable insights into 
consumer behavior and economic conditions, enabling more responsive 
and effective economic strategies.
6.3.3. Methodological contributions
From a methodological perspective, this study contributes to the 
literature by demonstrating the practical application of advanced ma-
chine learning algorithms and clustering techniques in retail analytics. 
Previous studies, such as those by [46], have discussed the theoretical 
underpinnings of these techniques. This study provides a practical 
illustration of their application, showcasing how the Apriori algorithm, 
K-Means clustering, and item-based collaborative filtering can be used 
to analyze large volumes of transaction data and extract meaningful 
insights.
Moreover, the integration of these techniques into a cohesive analyt-
ical framework represents a significant advancement in the field of Big 
Data analytics. By combining association rule mining with clustering 
and collaborative filtering, this study offers a comprehensive approach 
to understanding and predicting consumer behavior. This integrative 
approach aligns with the recommendations of [47], who emphasized 
the importance of combining different data mining techniques to gain 
a holistic understanding of complex datasets.
6.3.4. Future directions in research
Building on the findings and methodologies of this study, future 
research can explore several avenues to further advance the field of 
Big Data analytics in retail and macroeconomic analysis. One potential 
direction is to incorporate additional data sources, such as social media 
interactions and customer reviews, to gain a more nuanced understand-
ing of consumer preferences and trends. This multimodal approach can 
provide a richer and more comprehensive view of consumer behavior, 
as suggested by recent studies in the field of social media analytics [48].
Another promising direction is the application of advanced machine 
learning techniques, such as deep learning and reinforcement learning, 
to analyze consumer behavior data. These techniques have shown 
significant potential in various domains and can offer new insights into 
consumer behavior patterns and economic trends [49]. By leveraging 
these advanced techniques, researchers can develop more sophisticated 
models that capture the complex and dynamic nature of consumer 
behavior.
Finally, future research can explore the ethical and privacy impli-
cations of Big Data analytics in retail. As the use of consumer data 
becomes increasingly prevalent, it is crucial to address concerns related 
to data privacy and security. Studies focusing on the ethical use of Big 
Data can provide valuable guidelines for retailers and policymakers, 
ensuring that data analytics practices align with ethical standards and 
protect consumer privacy [10].
6.4. Strengthening the link between consumer behavior and macroeconomic 
policy
The analysis of shifts in consumer expenditure patterns, as re-
vealed through supermarket transaction data, provides an empirical 
basis for assessing the financial health of households. Specifically, 
this study found that during periods corresponding to macroeconomic 
downturns (e.g., inflation spikes, recessions), consumers reduced dis-
cretionary spending and concentrated purchases on essential goods 
such as fresh produce and dairy products. This behavior is consistent 
with findings in the broader economic literature (e.g., Athey & Im-
bens, 2019 [45]; Jaravel, 2019 [44]), which establish consumption 
smoothing and expenditure substitution as indicators of financial stress.
By continuously monitoring these shifts through Big Data analytics, 
policymakers can develop early-warning systems to detect signs of eco-
nomic contraction. For example, a persistent increase in the proportion 
of essential goods purchases relative to non-essential goods could serve 
as a leading indicator of declining consumer confidence and impending 
economic slowdown. Similarly, abrupt reductions in the frequency and 
volume of supermarket purchases might signal household liquidity 
constraints.
Policy Implications
• Monetary Policy: Central banks can incorporate real-time con-
sumer spending patterns into their inflation forecasting models, 
adjusting interest rates more proactively to stabilize demand.
• Fiscal Policy: Governments could use expenditure data to target 
stimulus measures (e.g., direct cash transfers or subsidies) to 
vulnerable households before a full-scale recession materializes.
• Social Policy: Consumer behavior trends can inform the design 
of food assistance programs and social safety nets during periods 
of economic stress.
Thus, supermarket transaction data, when systematically analyzed, not 
only reflects individual purchasing behavior but also provides a valu-
able macroeconomic diagnostic tool for real-time policy intervention.

macroeconomic analysis, several challenges must be acknowledged:
• Data Privacy and Security Concerns: The extensive use of per-
sonal consumer data raises substantial concerns regarding privacy 
and data protection. Retailers must ensure compliance with reg-
ulatory frameworks such as the General Data Protection Regula-
tion (GDPR) and implement robust data governance policies to 
safeguard sensitive information.
• Biases in Datasets: Big Data may inadvertently reflect historical 
biases or sampling errors, leading to skewed insights. For ex-
ample, datasets may underrepresent certain demographic groups, 
resulting in biased recommendations and reinforcing existing in-
equalities.
• Computational Complexity: Processing and analyzing vast
datasets require significant computational resources and
advanced algorithms. High-dimensional data can lead to scala-
bility challenges, where model training and inference become 
time-consuming and resource-intensive.
These challenges highlight the necessity for ethical considerations, 
careful dataset management, and ongoing technological innovation 
to ensure that Big Data analytics provides accurate, fair, and secure 
insights.
7.2. Study limitations
While this study offers valuable insights, certain limitations must be 
acknowledged:
• Generalizability of Findings: The analysis is based on data from 
a single supermarket chain, which may limit the generalizability 
of the findings to other retailers or geographic contexts. Future 
research could utilize more diverse datasets to enhance external

• Scalability of Models: Although the machine learning algorithms 
employed (e.g., Apriori, K-Means clustering, and collaborative 
filtering) yielded useful results, their scalability to much larger, 
real-world datasets remains a challenge. Particularly, algorithms 
like user-based collaborative filtering exhibited computational 
constraints during the study.
Addressing these limitations in future research could enhance the ro-
bustness and applicability of Big Data analytics approaches in retail and 
macroeconomic analyses.

ping days and times, retailers can optimize staffing and inven-
tory management, ensuring that they meet customer demand 
efficiently.
4. Continuous Data Analysis: Retailers should adopt a continuous 
data analysis approach to monitor changes in consumer behavior 
and adjust their strategies accordingly. This will help them stay 
responsive to market trends and maintain a competitive edge.
Policymakers can also benefit from the insights provided by Big 
Data analytics in the retail sector:
1. Economic Monitoring: Policymakers should consider incorporat-
ing Big Data analytics into their economic monitoring systems. 
Analyzing consumer spending patterns can provide real-time 
insights into economic conditions, allowing for timelier and 
effective policy interventions.
2. Consumer Confidence Indicators: Developing consumer confi-
dence indicators based on spending patterns can help in predict-
ing economic cycles and making informed policy decisions.
3. Data-Driven Policy Formulation: By leveraging data from various 
sectors, including retail, policymakers can formulate data-driven 
policies that address current economic challenges and promote 
sustainable growth.
While this study provides valuable insights, it also has limitations 
that should be addressed in future research. One limitation is the focus 
on a single supermarket chain, which may not fully represent consumer 
behavior across different regions and retail formats. Future studies 
should consider a more diverse dataset to enhance the generalizability 
of the findings.
Additionally, this study primarily used transaction data to ana-
lyze consumer behavior. Future research could incorporate other data 
sources, such as social media interactions and customer reviews, to 
gain a more comprehensive understanding of consumer preferences and
