Abstract
This project focuses on creating a system that can automatically find the best route between
two points by analyzing an image. It identifies all important nodes and the edges connecting
them using simple color-based processing. These connections are then turned into a graph, and
Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to find the shortest and alternative paths. The system works without
manual input and can be easily extended to real maps, navigation tools, and autonomous
technologies.
Chapter 1
Introduction
In our project, pathfinding means determining the shortest and safest route between two points
on the graph generated from the V oronoi image. The algorithm first detects nodes and edges
from the image, converts them into a graph, and then calculates the optimal path using techniques
like Dijkstra. It also identifies alternative routes so that even if one path is blocked or inefficient,
other valid paths can still be used. This helps us analyze how movement can be optimized in
complex, real-world environments.
1.1 Context of the Study
General domain of our project is Image Processing..
Image processing is important today because it allows computers to automatically understand
and analyze visual data. It enables faster and more accurate interpretation of images in fields
like medical diagnosis, security surveillance, autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, and
digital mapping. As images have become a major source of information, image processing
helps extract meaningful patterns, detect objects, and convert visual information into usable
digital data. This makes it essential for modern AI, automation, and intelligent decision-making
systems.
1.2 Objectives
Objective of the project are listed below:
To detectnodes and edges from a given image and convert them into an accurate graph
representation.
To computethe shortest path between any selected source and destination using efficient
algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra).
To visualizeall paths clearly on the image, helping users understand how the graph behaves.
To analyzeand compare different paths based on distance, structure, and real-world relevance.
Chapter 1. Introduction
To createa tool that can be used for navigation, robotics, and autonomous systems research.
1.3 Contributions
This project contributes a practical and efficient solution for extracting graph structures from
images and computing both shortest and alternative paths. It combines image processing with
graph algorithms to create an automated path-finding system.
Key contributions are listed below:
Automated Graph Extraction
The project converts complex images into accurate node–edge graphs without manual intervention,
reducing human effort and errors.
Reliable Path-Finding SystemBy integrating Dijkstra and K-shortest path algorithms, the
system not only finds the shortest route but also provides multiple alternative paths for better
decision-making.
Real-Time Visualization
The project visually highlights paths directly on the input image, making it easier for users to
understand how the algorithm operates.
Useful for Modern Applications
The approach can support autonomous vehicles, robotics, navigation tools, and research in
graph-based image analysis.
Addresses a Real Gap
Many existing systems rely on manually drawn graphs or predefined datasets. This project
bridges the gap by allowing graphs to be derived automatically from raw images, making the
method more flexible and scalable.
1.4 Methodology Overview
To solve this problem, we first process the image to identify important features like nodes and
connections. These are then converted into a graph structure so that algorithms like Dijkstra’s
can analyze all possible routes. Using this combination of image processing and graph theory,
we can automatically detect valid paths and find the most efficient route between a chosen start
and end point.

Literature Review
2.1 Introduction to Literature Survey
The integration of unmanned vehicles with satellite and aerial imagery has revolutionized
autonomous navigation systems across diverse applications including autonomous ground vehicles
(UGVs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UA Vs), and intelligent transportation systems. Path planning
represents a critical component in autonomous navigation, enabling vehicles to determine
optimal routes from source to destination while navigating complex environments and avoiding
obstacles.
The convergence of remote sensing technology, image processing techniques, and algorithmic
advances has created unprecedented opportunities for developing sophisticated path planning
systems based on satellite imagery. Traditional path planning approaches often rely on pre-constructed
high-precision maps or expensive commercial services, which limits accessibility and introduces
dependency issues. In contrast, satellite imagery-based path planning leverages freely available
geospatial data from services such as Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, and Bing Maps, providing
cost-effective and readily accessible solutions for autonomous vehicle navigation in outdoor
environments.
This literature survey examines the state-of-the-art in path planning for unmanned vehicles
utilizing satellite images. The survey encompasses road detection methodologies, path planning
algorithms, emerging deep learning approaches, and system integration challenges.
2.2 Existing Systems / Related Work
2.2.1 Traditional Road Detection Methods
Early approaches to road extraction from satellite imagery primarily relied on handcrafted
features and image processing techniques. These methods typically employ a combination
of color filtering, edge detection, and morphological operations to identify road regions. The
foundational work in this area established that roads exhibit specific characteristics distinguishable
from surrounding features, including constant width, low curvature, and relatively uniform
spectral properties [1].
Classical techniques leverage multiple image processing filters including Difference of Gaussian
Chapter 2. Literature Review
(DoG) filters to enhance road boundaries and emphasize edges between regions of different
intensities. The Radon transform has been particularly effective for detecting linear structures
characteristic of roads, especially when applied to grid sub-regions to identify local road segments
[1]. These methods often incorporate color-based probability models trained on local regions to
accommodate varying road surface materials such as asphalt, concrete, gravel, and unimproved
earth surfaces.
A significant contribution in this domain was the hybrid approach combining road map image
analysis with satellite image processing. This methodology exploits prior knowledge from
online map services to simplify road detection while supplementing incomplete annotations
through satellite image analysis [1]. The approach demonstrates that road network detection
can be achieved with acceptable accuracy (approximately 95%) at lower computational costs
compared to pure satellite image-based methods.
2.2.2 Deep Learning-Based Road Segmentation
The emergence of deep learning has fundamentally transformed road detection from satellite
imagery. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated superior capability in
learning complex texture patterns and handling various environmental conditions without explicit
feature engineering [2][3]. Seminal work by Mnih and colleagues established that neural
networks trained on high-resolution aerial imagery could automatically detect roads with reasonable
accuracy, introducing the Massachusetts Roads Dataset as a benchmark resource[4].
Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) represent a major architectural advancement, enabling
end-to-end learning of pixel-wise classification tasks. FCNs eliminate the need for fully connected
layers while maintaining the ability to process images of arbitrary size [5][6][7]. This architecture
allows efficient semantic segmentation of road regions directly from satellite imagery.
The U-Net architecture, originally developed for biomedical image segmentation, has become
the dominant framework for road extraction tasks. U-Net’s symmetric encoder-decoder structure
with skip connections effectively preserves low-level spatial details critical for accurate road
boundary delineation. Recent studies demonstrate U-Net achieves approximately 92% overall
accuracy in road surface classification from aerial imagery [6]. The architecture’s ability to
transfer low-level features to high-level processing through skip connections proves particularly
valuable for maintaining road continuity and accurately delineating boundaries.
Advanced variants of U-Net incorporating residual blocks and attention mechanisms have
further improved performance. Residual U-Net (RU-Net) combines advantages of U-Net,
residual learning, atrous spatial pyramid pooling, and focal loss to handle class imbalance
problems typical in road segmentation tasks [8]. These enhanced architectures achieve competitive
performance on benchmark datasets while improving training stability through reduced network
degradation in deeper layers.
DeepLabV3+ has emerged as another prominent architecture for road extraction, utilizing
atrous convolution for multi-scale feature extraction. Recent research introduces Dense Depthwise
Dilated Separable Spatial Pyramid Pooling (DenseDDSSPP) modules to enhance extraction of
Sister Nivedita University, WBPage 4
Chapter 2. Literature Review
complex road structures, demonstrating superior performance over conventional Atrous Spatial
Pyramid Pooling approaches [9].
2.2.3 Advanced Neural Network Architectures
Recent advances extend beyond traditional CNN architectures to incorporate attention mechanisms
and transformer-based approaches. Vision Transformers (ViTs) represent a paradigm shift by
replacing convolutional operations with self-attention mechanisms, enabling better capture of
global context and long-range dependencies [10][11]. These approaches prove particularly
effective for handling occlusions and complex road geometries that challenge conventional
CNNs.
Hybrid architectures combining multiple neural network paradigms have shown promising
results. Research introducing MambaVision-based frameworks with transformer capabilities
demonstrates improved 3D lane and road detection even with elevation variations and complex
road structures [11]. Attention-based mechanisms within semantic segmentation networks
enable models to focus on relevant features while suppressing background noise and vegetation
occlusions.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) introduce a novel paradigm for road extraction by directly
predicting road graph structures. Rather than generating pixel-level segmentation maps followed
by post-processing vectorization, GNN-based approaches combine Fully Convolutional Networks
for identifying points of interest (intersections, turns, dead ends) with Graph Neural Networks
for predicting connectivity between these points [12]. This end-to-end approach eliminates
extensive post-processing while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for embedded
devices.
Combination of CNN and GNN frameworks achieve regularized road surface extraction
approaching human-level delineation quality. These methods formulate road surface extraction
as two-sided width inference, utilizing CNN-based feature extractors and GNN models for
global optimization of road width regularization [13]. Such integrated approaches demonstrate
superior intersection over union scores and improved visual quality compared to pure CNN-based
methods.
2.2.4 Path Planning Algorithms
Path planning algorithms form the computational backbone for autonomous navigation. Classical
algorithms remain fundamental to contemporary systems despite recent deep learning advances.
Dijkstra’s Algorithmprovides guaranteed optimal shortest path detection in weighted graphs
with non-negative edge costs. Its application to road network graphs derived from satellite
imagery ensures minimal distance travel for autonomous vehicles [1]. While computationally
efficient for moderate graph sizes, Dijkstra’s algorithm exhibits increased computational complexity
in large-scale urban environments.
A* Algorithmenhances Dijkstra’s approach through heuristic guidance, reducing the search
space by prioritizing nodes predicted closer to the goal. The algorithm combines the proven
optimality of Dijkstra with heuristic functions, proving particularly effective for GPS-aided
Sister Nivedita University, WBPage 5
Chapter 2. Literature Review
navigation systems and real-time applications [14][15][16].
Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT)represent sampling-based planning approaches
that generate feasible paths by exploring configuration space incrementally. RRT-based methods
excel in high-dimensional spaces and complex obstacle environments, demonstrating capability
to escape local minima more effectively than deterministic algorithms [3][17]. RRT variants
including RRT* introduce asymptotic optimality through incremental rewiring, though at increased
computational cost [17].
Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM)methods construct multi-query roadmaps enabling efficient
path queries across diverse start-end configurations. Unlike RRT’s single-query focus, PRM’s
roadmaps remain valid for multiple mission profiles, proving advantageous for fleet operations
[18][19]. Temporal PRM extensions incorporate dynamic obstacle constraints by encoding
time-dependent collision information within the roadmap structure [20].
Artificial Potential Field (APF)algorithms model obstacles as repulsive forces and goals as
attractive forces, enabling real-time path computation. APF methods integrate naturally with
collision avoidance frameworks and support dynamic environments, though susceptibility to
local minima remains a recognized limitation [15].
Best-First Search (BFS)andDepth-First Search (DFS)provide foundational graph exploration
strategies employed within hybrid planning frameworks. BFS guarantees shortest paths in
unweighted graphs while DFS offers memory efficiency, with performance characteristics varying
based on environmental structure [15][16].
2.2.5 Multi-Agent and Cooperative Path Planning
Multi-agent path planning addresses coordination among multiple autonomous vehicles in
shared environments. Conflict Detection and Resolution (CDR) methods ensure collision-free
trajectories across vehicle fleets, implementing pre-flight planning phases to resolve conflicts
before mission execution [21].
Cooperative A* (CA*)extends single-agent A* planning to multiple agents through iterative
conflict resolution and replanning. Enhanced Conflict-Based Search (ECBS) improves computational
efficiency through batching mechanisms, proving more time-efficient for dynamic fleet management
scenarios [21].
Multi-agent optimization techniques including clustering and task allocation use K-means or
Fuzzy C-means methods to distribute targets among UA Vs. Combined with route optimization
algorithms and collision avoidance verification, these approaches enable efficient large-scale
fleet coordination [22].
Heterogeneous multi-agent frameworks incorporate agents with distinct capabilities and priorities.
Recent research demonstrates cooperative approaches where low-priority agents conduct exploration
and threat localization while high-priority agents navigate to destinations with risk minimization,
Sister Nivedita University, WBPage 6
Chapter 2. Literature Review
utilizing decentralized optimization and probabilistic constraints [23][24].
2.2.6 Integration of Road Detection with Path Planning
Integrated systems combine road detection outputs directly with path planning algorithms. The
reference paper by Hoang et al. demonstrates a complete pipeline: road networks detected from
map and satellite images are converted to Mercator coordinate systems and graph representations,
then processed through Dijkstra’s algorithm with BFS heuristics to compute optimal vehicle
trajectories [1].
The extracted road network, represented as a directed graph with vertices corresponding to
intersections and endpoints, and edges representing road segments, provides natural input to
graph search algorithms. Euclidean distances between connected vertices define edge costs,
enabling shortest path computation under the assumption of no dynamic obstacles [1].
This integration approach achieves significant improvements over pure satellite image-based
methods or isolated online map services. By combining the strengths of both information
sources prior knowledge from map services ensuring high confidence and satellite images
detecting unmapped road segments—integrated systems construct comprehensive road networks
suitable for real-world autonomous navigation [1].
2.2.7 Benchmark Datasets
Massachusetts Roads Datasetcomprises 1,171 high-resolution aerial images (1,500 × 1,500
pixels) covering 2.25 square kilometers each, spanning over 2,600 square kilometers across
Massachusetts with diverse urban, suburban, and rural environments. The dataset’s training set
contains 1,108 images, validation set 14 images, and test set 49 images, enabling comprehensive
evaluation of road detection algorithms [4][25].
DeepGlobe 2018 Datasetprovides high-resolution satellite imagery specifically designed
for semantic segmentation tasks including road extraction. This dataset facilitates training
and evaluation of deep learning models across diverse geographic regions and environmental
conditions [26].
RoadTracer Datasetenables evaluation of road graph extraction methods through iterative
graph construction approaches. Graph-based methods are benchmarked against baseline performance
using this resource [12][27].
These benchmark datasets have proven instrumental in advancing road detection methodologies
by providing standardized evaluation protocols and enabling direct comparison among competing
approaches.
2.3 Limitations of Existing Systems
2.3.1 Road Detection Challenges
Despite significant advances, road detection from satellite imagery faces persistent technical
challenges:
Occlusion Issuesremain the most significant limitation. Dense vegetation, shadows from
Sister Nivedita University, WBPage 7
Chapter 2. Literature Review
buildings and trees, tunnels, and overpasses frequently obscure road surfaces, rendering them
invisible in satellite imagery. Spectral properties of vegetation and building shadows closely
resemble some road surface characteristics, creating ambiguity in pixel-level classification
[28][29][30].
Spectral Variabilityof road surfaces complicates detection algorithms. Different materials—asphalt,
concrete, brick, gravel, and unpaved surfaces—exhibit distinct spectral signatures. Within-material
variations due to age, weathering, and different manufacturing processes introduce additional
complexity. Model adaptation across diverse road types and geographic regions requires substantial
retraining effort [1][28].
Low Image Resolutionand degraded image quality in certain regions limit detection accuracy.
While high-resolution satellite imagery (sub-meter resolution) facilitates detection, many regions
lack access to such data. Public satellite services provide varying resolutions depending on
geographic location and temporal coverage [25].
Class Imbalancepresents a persistent challenge in deep learning-based approaches. Road
pixels constitute a small fraction of satellite images relative to background pixels (buildings,
vegetation, water, non-road areas). This class imbalance biases models toward conservative
predictions, reducing sensitivity to small or faint road segments [28][29].
Road Connectivity and Continuityerrors frequently occur when detection models fail to
maintain connection between road segments, particularly at intersections or when roads pass
through tree cover. Short-distance discontinuities in detection results require sophisticated
post-processing and geometric constraints to resolve [1][28].
2.3.2 Computational Complexity and Real-Time Constraints
High Computational Overheadcharacterizes many state-of-the-art deep learning approaches.
Large CNN models with numerous parameters require substantial GPU resources for inference.
While essential for maximum accuracy, this computational demand conflicts with real-time,
on-board processing requirements for autonomous vehicles [31].
Embedding Constraintson autonomous vehicles limit deployable model complexity. Edge
devices aboard UA Vs and ground vehicles possess limited memory, processing power, and
energy budgets. Balancing model accuracy against these resource constraints remains an open
research challenge [31].
Real-Time Processing Latencyrequirements necessitate path planning computation within
seconds rather than minutes. Complex sampling-based algorithms like RRT and PRM incur
high computational costs in large-scale environments, while A* algorithm computational complexity
increases significantly in highly populated graphs characteristic of detailed urban maps [16].
2.3.3 Path Planning Algorithm Limitations
Graph Size and Complexityin dense urban environments create computational bottlenecks.
As road networks grow more complex with numerous intersections and branch connections,
search-based algorithms experience increased memory requirements and extended computation
times [16].
Sister Nivedita University, WBPage 8
Chapter 2. Literature Review
Local Minima Susceptibilityaffects potential field-based methods, where vehicles become
trapped in local attractive-repulsive force equilibria without reaching actual destinations. While
random sampling methods like RRT mitigate this issue, they introduce non-deterministic behavior
and variable solution quality [15][32][33].
Dynamic Obstacle Handlingpresents challenges for static path planning approaches. Many
classical algorithms assume static environments, requiring substantial modifications for incorporation
of dynamic obstacles (moving vehicles, pedestrians) or time-dependent constraints [32][20][34].
Optimality Guarantees versus Computational Efficiencypresent fundamental tradeoffs.
Algorithms guaranteeing optimal solutions (Dijkstra, A*) require extensive search, while approximate
methods (RRT, heuristic-based approaches) compute faster with suboptimal results [15][16].
2.3.4 Environmental and Operational Constraints
GPS Denial and GNSS Availabilitylimitations prevent reliance on satellite positioning in
contested environments, tunnels, urban canyons, and other areas with signal blockage. Alternative
localization approaches including visual odometry, SLAM, and inertial navigation systems
incur additional computational overhead and calibration complexity [35][36][37].
Weather Conditions and Seasonal Variationsaffect satellite imagery quality and road
detection accuracy. Cloud cover obscures underlying road networks, while seasonal vegetation
changes alter spectral characteristics. Temporal resolution limitations restrict update frequency
for dynamic road conditions [29][30].
Data Currency and Update Frequencyissues plague map-based approaches. Road networks
undergo constant change through construction, closures, and new development. Satellite imagery
temporal resolution may lag actual ground conditions by weeks or months, introducing potential
navigation hazards [1][29].
2.3.5 Integration and System-Level Challenges
End-to-End Optimizationbetween detection and planning stages remains underdeveloped.
Road detection accuracy directly impacts subsequent path planning results, yet optimization
frequently proceeds independently. Detection errors propagate through planning stages without
mitigation mechanisms [1].
Uncertainty Propagationfrom detection stages through planning produces cumulative errors
in final trajectories. Confidence metrics and uncertainty quantification in detection outputs
could inform more robust planning but are rarely integrated [38][28].
Transfer Learning and Generalizationlimitations restrict model applicability across diverse
geographic regions and image sources. Models trained on specific datasets often experience
significant performance degradation on new regions with different imaging characteristics, road

2.4 Comparative Study / Gap Analysis
2.4.1 Method Comparison: Handcrafted Features vs. Deep Learning
Handcrafted Feature-Based Approachesprovide interpretable processing pipelines with well-understood
behavior characteristics. These methods require limited training data, operate with low computational
requirements, and enable direct incorporation of domain knowledge through carefully designed
filters and processing sequences. However, they suffer from limited adaptability across diverse
environments, require manual parameter tuning for different geographic regions, and typically
achieve lower accuracy than deep learning methods, particularly in challenging conditions with
occlusions and spectral variability [40][4][7][41].
Deep Learning Approachesautomatically learn discriminative features from large training
datasets, eliminating handcrafted feature engineering. These methods achieve substantially
higher accuracy (90%+ for well-trained models) and demonstrate better generalization across
diverse environmental conditions. However, they require extensive labeled training data, demand
significant computational resources for training and inference, exhibit limited interpretability
("black box" behavior), and risk overfitting to dataset-specific characteristics with poor cross-dataset
generalization [2][3][5][6][7].
Recent trends favor deep learning approaches for production systems despite higher complexity,
as accuracy improvements often justify increased resource requirements. Hybrid approaches
combining CNN feature extraction with traditional geometric constraints show promise in
balancing accuracy and interpretability [7][28][13].

2.4.3 Integration Gaps Between Detection and Planning
Current systems frequently operate detection and planning stages independently without joint
optimization:
Sister Nivedita University, WBPage 10
Chapter 2. Literature Review
■Detection optimization targets pixel-level accuracy metrics (precision, recall, IoU) without
considering downstream planning impacts
■Planning algorithms assume perfectly accurate road networks without modeling detection
uncertainty
■End-to-end training frameworks jointly optimizing detection and planning components
remain rare
■Detection errors propagate through planning with limited error mitigation mechanisms
Addressing these integration gaps could yield substantial improvements in overall system performance
and robustness.
2.5 Summary of Literature Review
2.5.1 Key Findings
The literature review reveals a maturing field with accelerating progress driven by deep learning
advances, expanding dataset availability, and increasing computational resources. Several key
findings emerge:
1. Deep Learning Dominates Current PracticeCNN-based approaches have substantially
displaced handcrafted feature methods in production systems. U-Net and its variants achieve
>90% accuracy on benchmark datasets, with Vision Transformers pushing performance toward
96
2. Hybrid Integration Approaches Show PromiseSystems combining satellite images
with online map services (e.g., Google Maps, OpenStreetMap) demonstrate superior performance
compared to either source alone. This hybrid strategy leverages the strengths of each data
source while mitigating individual limitations. Road detection accuracy of 95% combined with
low computational costs validates this approach.
3. Classical Path Planning Algorithms Remain FundamentalDespite emergence of
learning-based approaches, Dijkstra, A*, and probabilistic methods remain core to production
systems. These algorithms provide optimality guarantees, well-understood behavior, and integration
with existing infrastructure. Recent extensions incorporating time-dependent constraints (T-PRM)
and dynamic obstacles demonstrate continued relevance.
4. Persistent Technical Challenges Constrain PerformanceOcclusion by vegetation and
buildings remains the most significant obstacle to fully automatic road detection. Class imbalance
in training data, spectral variability of road surfaces, and spectral similarity between roads and
backgrounds continue to limit accuracy even for state-of-the-art methods.
5. Real-Time Processing Constraints Drive ResearchEmbedding autonomous vehicle
systems necessitate real-time processing on resource-constrained platforms. This requirement
Sister Nivedita University, WBPage 11
Chapter 2. Literature Review
drives interest in lightweight architectures (ESANet, MobileNets) and classical algorithms
despite their potential suboptimality compared to more complex methods.
6. Multi-Agent Coordination Frameworks MatureCooperative planning methods for
UA V fleets (ECBS, multi-agent optimization, conflict-based search) demonstrate capability
for coordinating multiple vehicles in shared airspace. These approaches represent significant
advancement for future autonomous systems.
7. Uncertainty Integration Remains UnderdevelopedFew systems explicitly incorporate
uncertainty from detection stages into planning algorithms. This gap represents a critical
opportunity for improving robustness and safety through probabilistic approaches.
2.5.2 Conclusion
Path planning for unmanned vehicles based on satellite images has evolved into a mature
research domain combining advances in remote sensing, computer vision, machine learning,
and robotics. Deep learning methods have substantially improved road detection accuracy,
while classical planning algorithms remain fundamental to production systems. However,
persistent technical challenges—particularly occlusions and real-time processing constraints—continue
to drive research innovation.
The convergence toward hybrid systems combining satellite imagery with online maps, deep
learning perception with classical planning algorithms, and global path planning with local
obstacle avoidance represents the current state-of-practice. Future advancement lies in addressing
integration gaps between detection and planning, incorporating uncertainty throughout the
system, and developing robust frameworks suitable for deployment in diverse, GPS-denied
environments where autonomous vehicle systems must operate reliably under real-world constraints.
The field stands at an inflection point where mature individual components (detection algorithms,
planning methods, processing platforms) are increasingly integrated into coherent systems.
This integration represents both the greatest opportunity and most significant challenge for
advancing practical autonomous vehicle systems capable of operating safely and efficiently in
complex, real-world environments.

Problem Identification
3.1 Problem Statement
The core problem addressed in this project is the automated extraction and computation of
shortest paths between nodes within graph-based representations of navigable environments
obtained from image data. Traditional pathfinding depends on manually created high-precision
maps or costly commercial spatial databases, which are often outdated or unsuitable for real-world
use. This project aims to bridge the gap between image processing and algorithmic navigation
by automatically deriving navigable networks from visual sources (e.g., satellite images or
corridor maps), applying efficient shortest-path algorithms, and enabling reuse of precomputed
paths for future tasks. The main challenge is to achieve accuracy, computational efficiency, and
adaptability across diverse environments while reducing reliance on external map resources.
3.2 Context and Background of the Problem
Path planning in complex environments is a foundational challenge in image processing, autonomous
systems, and intelligent navigation. Accurate detection, interpretation, and traversal of spaces—from
indoor layouts to expansive road networks—directly influence fields such as robotics, autonomous
vehicles, transportation automation, and smart infrastructure. Modern systems increasingly
require navigation solutions that operate even when traditional mapping resources are unavailable
or impractical.
This project focuses on integrating computer vision with graph-based pathfinding. By extracting
spatial information from visual inputs and converting it into computational graph structures, the
system enables autonomous agents to make navigation decisions solely from image data. This
capability is especially important for unmanned vehicles, mobile robots, emergency response
operations, and environments where rapid adaptation to changing or previously unmapped
spaces is required.
The broader relevance of this work extends beyond technical innovation. As urbanization and
autonomous technologies continue to grow, the need for reliable, scalable, and cost-effective
Chapter 3. Problem Identification
visual-based navigation solutions becomes increasingly significant. Automating the interpretation
of visual environments and generating navigation paths directly supports real-world demands
across transportation, security, and disaster-response applications.
3.3 Need and Importance of Solving the Problem
Solving the identified pathfinding challenges holds strong practical and theoretical importance.
Developing automated navigation systems directly benefits several key areas:
Autonomous Systems:Unmanned vehicles, drones, and mobile robots require reliable navigation
without depending on external maps. Automated path extraction from imagery increases autonomy,
safety, and operational range.
Emergency Response:During disasters, existing maps may be outdated or infrastructure may
be damaged. Systems that derive navigation data from current imagery enable faster, more
accurate response and resource deployment.
Cost Reduction:Automating map creation and path planning reduces expenses associated
with manual surveying, licensing, and database maintenance.
Operational Efficiency:Reusing previously computed paths lowers computational load, allowing
systems to handle more queries or operate effectively on limited hardware.
From a broader perspective, improved autonomous navigation enhances transportation safety,
accessibility, and smart-city automation. Theoretically, this work advances the integration
of computer vision and algorithmic planning, demonstrating practical applications of image
processing, graph theory, and optimization.
3.4 Scope and Project Objectives:
This project aims to develop and validate an integrated system for image-based path planning
with clear, measurable objectives. The main objectives are:
Graph Extraction:Create robust image-processing pipelines to automatically extract node-and-edge
graph structures from visual data such as satellite images and corridor maps. This includes
preprocessing, feature detection, network construction, and coordinate transformation.
Shortest Path Implementation:Integrate efficient shortest-path algorithms to compute optimal
routes between specified source and target nodes, prioritizing both accuracy and computational
performance.
Path Storage and Reuse:Develop mechanisms to store previously computed paths in a
structured format and determine when stored paths can be reused, reducing redundant calculations.
Validation and Testing:Assess system performance using real-world test data, including
indoor layouts and satellite imagery. Evaluation will focus on path accuracy, computation time,
and improvements achieved through path reuse.
Sister Nivedita University, WBPage 14
Chapter 3. Problem Identification
Documentation and Analysis:Provide detailed documentation of the methodology, implementation,
experimental results, and comparative evaluation against existing approaches.
The project scope focuses solely on algorithmic and computational aspects of path planning
using standard visual data, excluding advanced sensing technologies or scenarios beyond typical
imagery conditions.
3.5 Anticipated Challenges
The project involves several technical challenges that must be addressed for successful system
development:
Image Processing Accuracy:Extracting reliable network structures from images requires
handling noise, occlusions, illumination changes, and visual ambiguities. Ensuring that the
generated graph accurately reflects actual navigable paths is essential.
Algorithm Integration:Connecting image-processing outputs with graph-based pathfinding
algorithms demands careful alignment of data structures and coordinate systems. Any mismatch
can introduce cumulative errors that reduce path quality.
Dynamic Environments:Real-world environments evolve over time as obstacles appear or
routes change. The system must either adapt to such variations or clearly specify its operational
limits.
Computational Performance:Achieving both accuracy and real-time speed is challenging.
Advanced image processing and thorough path searches improve quality but may slow performance,
requiring efficient optimization.
Path Storage Efficiency:Reusing shortest paths requires effective data structures, balanced
storage requirements, and fast retrieval methods. The system must manage memory constraints
while supporting efficient reuse.
Validation Complexity:Rigorous validation across diverse scenarios demands extensive datasets
and well designed experiments. Ensuring that system performance generalizes to real-world
settings requires comprehensive evaluation.

Proposed Methodology
4.1 Introduction to Methodology
The core problem addressed in this project is the automatic construction of a complete and
topologically correct road-network graph from visual map data, enabling reliable shortest-path
computation in regions where conventional digital maps such as OpenStreetMap remain incomplete.
A systematic and structured methodology is required because the input image contains noise,
variable coloring, occlusions, and hand-drawn structures that cannot be directly converted
into graph form without multiple stages of image processing, feature extraction, and graph
validation.
To solve this, the project adopts a computer-vision-driven analytical pipeline that transforms
a corridor-based image into a valid navigation graph. The methodology combines image
preprocessing, color-based vertex extraction, corridor sampling for edge validation, and classical
graph-search algorithms to ensure precise node detection and robust connectivity estimation.
This approach uses deterministic, interpretable image-processing techniques paired with Dijkstra’s
shortest-path algorithm, resulting in a fully autonomous, explainable, and resource-efficient
solution.
4.2 System Architecture / Conceptual Framework
Chapter 4. Proposed Methodology
Figure 4.1: Flowchart of the methodology.
Sister Nivedita University, WBPage 17
Chapter 4. Proposed Methodology
4.3 Algorithms / Techniques Used
4.3.1 Color-Based Image Segmentation (RGB Thresholding)
The system uses deterministic RGB thresholding to detect the orange junction points and black
corridor lines in the input image. For orange vertex detection, pixel-level rules such as:
R > 200
90 < G < 200
B < 90
are applied to isolate orange-colored road intersections. Similarly, pixels with:
R < 50, G < 50, B < 50
are classified as black corridor pixels representing road segments. This approach was chosen
because the input is a rendered map with high color consistency, making traditional thresholding
more robust and faster than a CNN-based detector. Additionally, thresholding avoids the need
for training data and ensures deterministic, explainable results.
4.3.2 Morphological Operations(Opening and Closing:)
Noise in the thresholded mask is removed using:
Binary Opening-removes small isolated pixels
Binary Closing-fills small gaps between connected orange pixels
These steps ensure that each junction becomes a single clean connected component, enabling
accurate centroid estimation. Morphology is preferred over complex filtering because it preserves
structural shape while cleaning noise.
4.3.3 Connected Component Analysis (Node Extraction)
After cleaning the orange mask, the system applies connected component labeling to group
pixels belonging to the same node. For each component:
Centroid
Radius(max pixel distance from centroid)
are computed.
This algorithm ensures consistent detection of node locations regardless of small variations in
drawing thickness or shape. It is chosen over clustering algorithms like K-means because the
regions are already spatially connected, making connected-components the most efficient and
accurate method.
Sister Nivedita University, WBPage 18
Chapter 4. Proposed Methodology
4.3.4 Corridor Sampling for Edge Validation (Black Ratio Test)
For every pair of nodes (i, j):
1. A straight line is drawn between centroids.
2. The sample range is trimmed by the node radii (to avoid sampling inside nodes).
3. A series of n = 220 equally spaced sample points is generated.
4. Around each sample, a neighborhood of radius = 2 pixels is scanned for black pixels.
5. black ratio = hits / samples
6. If black ratio≥0.75, the nodes are considered connected.
This corridor sampling method replaces alternatives like skeletonization or Hough transform
because:
It is more reliable on hand-drawn, imperfect lines.
It allows detection of corridors even if slightly broken or irregular.
It minimizes false edges between nodes that are geometrically close but not connected.
4.3.5 Adjacency Graph Construction
All validated connections are stored in an undirected adjacency list:
adj[node] = list of neighbors
This representation is memory-efficient, supports fast lookups, and integrates seamlessly with
shortest-path algorithms. The graph is also exported to a CSV file for verification and reproducibility.
4.3.6 Dijkstra’s Algorithm for Shortest Path Computation
The system uses Dijkstra’s Algorithm to compute the minimum-cost route between a selected
start and goal node. Edge weights are computed using Euclidean distance between node
centroids, ensuring that longer road segments incur higher traversal cost.
Dijkstra is chosen over A* because:
The mapdoes not provide heuristic information in real-world coordinates
The graphis small (≈30-40 nodes), making Dijkstra computationally efficient
Exactshortest-path guarantees are required
4.4 Expected Outcome
The proposed system is expected to successfully process a corridor-based map image and
convert it into a structured, navigation-ready graph. By detecting the orange junction points,
the system will accurately identify and localize all road intersections present in the image.
Using the black corridor lines, it will then validate real connections between these junctions
Sister Nivedita University, WBPage 19
Chapter 4. Proposed Methodology
and construct a complete adjacency representation of the road network. Based on the generated
graph, the system will be able to compute a shortest path between any selected start and
destination node using Dijkstra’s algorithm. The final output will be a visual representation of
the optimal route overlaid on the original image, along with the corresponding node sequence
that forms this path.
In future extensions, the proposed system can be expanded to work directly on real satellite or
aerial images instead of manually prepared corridor diagrams. The node and corridor detection
process can be adapted to handle more complex environments, including irregular road shapes,
intersections, and varying lighting conditions. GPS coordinate mapping may be integrated
so that detected nodes and paths correspond to real-world locations. Additionally, the graph
construction step can be extended to include weighted information such as road width or surface
type, making the system more useful for real-world autonomous navigation applications.

Results and Discussion

Figure 5.1: Input Image to test the algorithm
Figure 5.2: Output recieved
Chapter 5. Results and Discussion
5.1 Experimental results and discussion
The results show that the algorithm successfully extracts the graph from the input image, detects
nodes and edges using color segmentation and corridor sampling, and computes the shortest
path between specified start (V1) and end(V34) points.This confirms the algorithm’s capability
to process the environment, validate connectivity, and deliver an effective route for navigation
between input and output points as designed.
5.1.1 Comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods
This image-based pathfinding methodology is competitive because it constructs a graph directly
from an RGB environment image using color segmentation and pixel-level corridor sampling
to validate edges, ensuring paths correspond to actual traversable corridors. Unlike traditional
algorithms that rely on predefined graphs, grids, or V oronoi diagrams, this method integrates
image processing to dynamically extract navigation nodes and connections from visual data.
While classical algorithms like A* or Dijkstra focus on weighted graphs or grid maps with
heuristic guidance, this approach uses an unweighted graph derived from the image and applies
Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest path computation. This makes it particularly suitable for
complex, irregular environments represented visually rather than as explicit spatial graphs,
offering a unique blend of image understanding and pathfinding compared to existing methods.
5.1.2 Novelty of the proposed methodology
The follow are the Novelty features of our methodology:
■Image-Based Graph Construction:The algorithm constructs a graph from an RGB
image representing a spatial environment. It identifies vertices by detecting orange-colored
areas (likely representing nodes) using color thresholding on the image and cleans this
mask using morphological operations. Edges are derived by sampling along corridors
(black areas in the image) between vertices, evaluating connectivity based on a "black
pixel ratio" criterion.
■Corridor Sampling for Edge Validation:Instead of connecting nodes merely by distance
or explicit graph data, the algorithm samples pixels along the corridor between nodes to
ensure a high ratio (>= 95%) of black pixels (indicating free or traversable space). This
effectively builds edges only along navigable paths extracted from the image.
■Radius-Based Corridor Boundaries:When sampling the corridor between two nodes,
the algorithm uses the radius of each vertex to define the start and end boundaries of
sampling, excluding areas inside the nodes themselves. This provides a more accurate
corridor representation relative to node size.

Conclusion and Future Work
In conclusion, this project successfully demonstrates an image-based pathfinding algorithm that
extracts navigable graphs from environmental images and computes the shortest path between
designated points. The algorithm integrates image processing with graph search techniques to
handle complex, visually represented spaces. Future work will focus on refining the algorithm
to enhance accuracy and efficiency, followed by prototyping a practical application—such
as aiding a service robot in navigating autonomously within a defined perimeter—thereby
extending its utility to real-world robotic navigation scenarios.
