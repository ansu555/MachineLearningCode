The insurance industry has a giant role in the sustainable economic growth of any country. With an increase in 
the number of insurance buyers, it has become an absolute necessity for an insurance company to have a detailed 
claim analysis system in place. Claim Analysis is performed by insurance companies to distinguish between 
fraudulent and genuine claims. Apart from that, Claim Analysis can also be used to understand the client strata 
in a much better way and implement the results further during the underwriting and acceptance/denial stage 
of policy enrollment. The main objective of this research work is to identify meaningful and decisive factors for 
claim ﬁling and acceptance in a learning context through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature selection 
techniques. Also, machine learning algorithms are applied to the datasets and are evaluated using performance 
metrics. 
1. Introduction 
Insurance is ﬁnancial protection against any type of risk. This pro- 
tection is deﬁned by a contract between two parties: the insurer and 
the insured (beneﬁciary). The insurer is the company that sells the poli- 
cies and the insured is the person or the party which buys the insurance 
policy for its beneﬁts. The insurer agrees to take risk of an insured en- 
tity against future events in return for monetary compensation known 
as Premium ( Aswani, Ghrera, Chandra, & Kar, 2020 ). In case of an un- 
foreseen event, the insurer must pay a claim to the insured i.e. the ben- 
eﬁt amount to be paid to the beneﬁciary according to the policy doc- 
ument. Depending on the types of risk involved, insurance policies are 
of diﬀerent types. Life Insurance, Travel Insurance, Health Insurance, 
Auto Insurance and Property Insurance are some of the diﬀerent Line of 
Business’ (LOB) in the insurance industry ( Bacry et al., 2020 ). Another 
type of insurance is Re-insurance in which an insurance company pur- 
chases insurance from another insurance company to protect itself from 
ﬁnancial risk due to the event of an enormous claim Barry & Charpen- 
tier (2020) . The whole industry runs on the concept of risk or ﬁnancial 
loss reduction ( Batra, Jain, Tikkiwal, & Chakraborty, 2021 ). In such a 
deal, where the insurer has to ensure the client against any type of ﬁ- 
nancial loss against any unforeseen event, there must be a way for the 
insurer or the insurance company to manage their transactions to pay

claims as well as generate suﬃcient proﬁt to survive in the industry 
Blackstone (2013) . 
“InsurTech ”is the term used in association with bringing new tech- 
nologies and innovations in the ﬁeld of insurance to impact the regu- 
latory practices of insurance markets. Here comes the concept of “Big 
Data ”. Big Data has transformed the way insurance companies deals 
with the enormous amount of data that they receive. Due to the ad- 
vancement of technologies, the volume of data to be dealt with has 
enormously increased and this data can be structured, semi-structured 
as well as unstructured ( Chakraborty & Kar, 2017 ; Kar, 2016 ). Initially, 
and even now, many insurance companies use actuarial formulas for 
underwriting and mortality table for life expectancy assessment. Big 
Data technologies help to analyze data and extract important informa- 
tion from it that can lead to better decision making and strategic busi- 
ness development as compared to the above-mentioned traditional data- 
processing techniques ( Chowdhury, Mayilvahanan, & Govindaraj, 2020 ; 
Karhade et al., 2019 ). Data Mining plays an important role in various 
aspects of the insurance industry such as risk assessment, fraud detec- 
tion, underwriting analysis, claim analysis, marketing analytics, product 
development, customer proﬁling etc (D. Das, Chakraborty, & Banerjee, 
2020 ; S. Das, Datta, Zubaidi, & Obaid, 2021 ). Along with Data Min- 
ing, the industry is shifting towards machine learning algorithms to pre- 
dict using the analysis done on big datasets for better fraud detection,

KYC veriﬁcation, behavioural policy evaluation and custom claim settle- 
ments. The use of Machine Learning (ML) is increasing tremendously in 
the insurance industry despite initial resistance by the industry because 
of its explicitly recursive approach in predictive modelling which helps 
to improve the model at each repetition. In this analysis, we will deal 
with the claim analysis aspect of the insurance industry ( Dave, Patwa, 
& Pandit, 2021 ; Doupe, Faghmous, & Basu, 2019 ). ML is used in claim 
analysis & processing for triaging claims, identifying outlier claims & 
even fraud, and automating where possible i.e. reducing the human in- 
tervention in claim processing and making the whole process hassle- 
free ( Gupta, Kar, Baabdullah, & Al-Khowaiter, 2018 ; Kakhki, Freeman, 
& Mosher, 2020 ). The use of ML algorithms in this process helps the 
company to understand the beneﬁciary’s claim ﬁling pattern as well 
their claim acceptance pattern which can be used to optimize the whole 
process ﬂow for policy enrollment Kar (2016) . 
The purpose of this research is to understand how machine learn- 
ing algorithms can help in insurance companies to deduce patterns in 
various segments/branches of InsurTech (claim analysis is done in this 
research paper). In this analysis, two datasets are used to perform claim 
analysis using diﬀerent classiﬁcation algorithms. Three feature selection 
algorithms have been used to reduce the dimensionality of the data and 
to improve the results of the analysis. The algorithms are ﬁnally evalu- 
ated and compared based on four widely approved and trusted metrics: 
accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score. The following sections of the 
research work are literature review, proposed computational methodol- 
ogy, experimentation, results, discussion and conclusion. 
2. Literature review 
2.1. All about “InsurTech ”
InsurTech is simply bringing technology to the world of insurance. 
InsurTech companies have been able to come up with several business 
models to improve the contracting process as well the claims manage- 
ment process, helping customers to clearly understand where their pre- 
mium goes as well as how their premiums are structured. InsurTech 
technologies and innovations have helped to reach out to all the sec- 
tions of the economy, especially the lower-income bracket and the less 
developed markets. Most of the InsurTech companies are startups and 
due to the huge scale of customers they attract, many reinsurance com- 
panies invest in them. But while bringing new technologies to the mar- 
ket, they must be aware of the regulations of the insurance industry and 
meet them. Many countries have a well-established regulatory sandbox 
approach to allow InsurTech companies to enter the market so that such 
startups can grow their business models as well as keep up with the reg- 
ulatory requirements. India has a regulation policy in place for micro 
insurance regulations since 2015 ( Kasy, 2018 ; Kaur, Sharma, & Mittal, 
2018 ). Apart from the beneﬁts, InsurTech needs to balance the need for 
innovation as well as the need for the protection of data. There is a need 
for close inspection of the internal controls that ensure that the client’s 
data use is free of bias and the law is adhered to. 
2.2. Need for artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) & machine learning (ML) in 
insurance 
The insurance industry is one of the oldest industries in the world 
with marine insurance as the ﬁrst form of insurance, used for self- 
insurance. With the increase in client data, there is a huge scope for 
improvement in methodologies used in the sector for policy enrollment 
and claims settlement ( Khan, Bashir, & Qamar, 2014 ; Knighton et al., 
2020 ). Artiﬁcial Intelligence is the buzzword of the decade and it sim- 
ply means the enhancement of machine to simulate human intelligence 
( Kose, Gokturk, & Kilic, 2015 ; Kraus, Feuerriegel, & Oztekin, 2020 ). AI 
encompasses ML and predictive analysis which is taking the insurance 
industry by storm. AI helps in almost all the business needs of an in- 
surance company. AI speeds up the process of underwriting, as well as 
improves risk selection and pricing strategies ( Larson & Sinclair, 2021 ; 
Maehashi & Shintani, 2020 ). Not only that, but diﬀerent insights can 
also be drawn from the client’s data as well as personalization of poli- 
cies has become easier due to faster underwriting and analysis ( McGlade 
& Scott-Hayward, 2019 ; Mita et al., 2021 ). Claim processing has become 
automated using mobile applications ( Nian, Zhang, Tayal, Coleman, & 
Li, 2016 ). A thorough analysis can help with fraud detection. Insurance 
fraud is a 40 billion dollar industry per year, hence, the use of ML tech- 
niques can help to notify brokers in case of fraud to further investigate. 
The analysis tools used to gather insights on customer behaviour can 
also be used to gather insights on employees to retain valuable talent. 
This can be done by understanding the behaviour, interests, learning 
styles of the brokers as well as their job satisfaction and the potential to 
look out for a job somewhere else ( Ozbayoglu, Gudelek, & Sezer, 2020 ; 
Sengupta et al., 2020 ). Lastly, AI & ML can be used for the eﬀective mar- 
keting of insurance policies. Table 1 summarizes the major work done 
in the insurance sector. 
2.3. Claim analysis in insurance sector 
Statistics has been in use in the insurance industry from the onset 
of the industry. There is a whole discipline for the use of statistics in 
the insurance industry known as Actuarial Science. With the massive 
increase in data processed by the industry, Predictive Analytics is com- 
ing into the limelight ( Pal, Mandana, Pal, Sarkar, & Chakraborty, 2012 ; 
Yang et al., 2021 ). It encompasses data mining, predictive modelling, 
and machine learning techniques like classiﬁcation, regression, cluster- 
ing and outlier detection to make accurate and fast predictions about 
unforeseen events in the future using the current data ( Palanisamy & 
Thirunavukarasu, 2019 ). 
Claim Analysis is an important aspect of Predictive Analytics in the 
insurance industry as approximately 80% of the premium revenue gen- 
erated is spent on claims by the insurance companies Pappas & Wood- 
side (2021) . Hence, it is essential to do a thorough analysis of claims 
to improve cash ﬂow. By analyzing the insurance data, relations be- 
tween various factors (variables) is observed and a function is derived to 
model predictions ( Petropoulos, Siakoulis, Stavroulakis, & Vlachogian- 
nakis, 2020 ). These predictions can be used for making decisions. Apart 
from the structured data used by the companies, there is a huge scope 
of unstructured data that provides vital information ( Pourhabibi, Ong, 
Kam, & Boo, 2020 ; Waring, Lindvall, & Umeton, 2020 ). It can be used 
to cluster the diﬀerent categories of beneﬁciaries and calculate the ex- 
pected claim payout and processing for these categories ( Pramanik et al., 
2020 ). There are certain Key Performance Indicators (KPI) of insurance 
claims such as claims cycle time, customer satisfaction, fraud detec- 
tion, claims recovery and claim handling costs ( Richter & Khoshgof- 
taar, 2018 ). It is observed that out of the enormous amount of data that 
an insurance company has access to, it utilizes only 10-15% of that data 
( Ringshausen et al., 2021 ; Saggi & Jain, 2018 ). ML can help to increase 
the utilization of data keeping in mind the KPIs of claim, to automate 
many routine processes to reduce claims cycle time, increase customer 
satisfaction, combat fraud, optimize claims recovery and reduce claim 
handling costs . 
3. Proposed computational methodology 
In this analysis, two diﬀerent datasets are used to perform claim anal- 
ysis using ML classiﬁcation algorithms. Classiﬁcation algorithms are a 
type of Supervised ML algorithms. Supervised Learning is used when 
the data is divided into a set of input variables or features and there is a 
corresponding output or target variable. Supervised algorithms are fur- 
ther divided into classiﬁcation and regression algorithms. Classiﬁcation 
algorithms are used when the target variable is categorical in nature 
and regression algorithms are used when the target variable is continu- 
ous. For example, if an insurance company has to predict the premium

or claim amount, then regression algorithms can be used. In this anal- 
ysis, the outcomes of the analyses using the two datasets are diﬀerent, 
depending on the type of the datasets and the variables (features) in- 
volved. 
Apart from Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning is also im- 
plemented in the insurance industry. In the case of unsupervised learn- 
ing, there is no target variable. Unsupervised algorithms are further clas- 
siﬁed into Clustering and Association algorithms. Some use cases of un- 
supervised learning are to ﬁnd customers having similarities in various 
attributes, analyze customer attrition using clustering algorithms and 
discovering associations that improve or promotes the business in the 
case of association algorithms. 
As shown in Fig. 1 , the target variable in both datasets is categorical. 
Hence, classiﬁcation algorithms are used to do the analyses. Whenever 
ML algorithms are applied to a dataset, a framework is used to outline 
the process. This framework simpliﬁes the process as well as makes it 
easier to understand. The framework used in this analysis is designed 
based on Yufeng Guo’s 7 Steps of Machine Learning. Fig. 2 shows the 
framework used to perform claim analysis. 
3.1. Data collection 
Data Collection initiates the onset of the ML process. Data can be col- 
lected through various sources and methods. Searching and sharing is 
the most eﬀective and common way to collect data. Data can be searched 
on the web or obtained from a ‘data lake’ and be shared through the web. 
Another method in use is Data Augmentation. In this method instead of 
collecting new data, existing data is augmented with external data to in- 
crease the diversity of the dataset. This approach is mostly used in deep 
learning to develop and train large artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN). 
The last way to collect data is through crowdsourcing and generating 
synthetic datasets. 
The datasets used in the analysis are collected from Kaggle.com and 
Github.com. Further description is given in the “Case Studies ”section. 
3.2. Data preparation 
Data Preparation is the process of transforming data such that it is 
suitable for an ML algorithm. It can have a great impact on the per- 
formance of the model. It consists of data cleaning, exploratory data 
analysis (EDA), normalization and dimensionality reduction processes.

Fig. 2. ML Framework used for Claim Analysis. 
3.2.1. Data cleaning 
Data Cleaning is the ﬁrst step after the data is retrieved. It consists 
of detecting and removing inaccurate, false, incomplete, corrupt, or ir- 
relevant records from the dataset. Data cleaning is also called “Data 
Pre-Processing ”. One of the most common approaches for data clean- 
ing is variable-by-variable cleaning. In this approach, illegal or misspelt 
features values are removed from the dataset based on certain factors 
such as the minimum and maximum value should not be outside the per- 
missible range, the variance and standard deviation should not be more 
than the threshold value and there should not be any misspelt values in 
4 
S. Rawat, A. Rawat, D. Kumar et al. International Journal of Information Management Data Insights 1 (2021) 100012 
the dataset. Data values are either removed or manipulated depending 
on the coarseness of the data value. In case there are missing feature 
values, the feature is either eliminated if there are many missing values 
or the missing values are replaced by a dummy value (treating the miss- 
ing value itself as a new value). Mean substitution is the most common 
approach for treating missing values. 
3.2.2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) 
EDA is an aid to understanding the data before applying any ma- 
chine learning model to it. It is done by visualizing data with the help 
of diﬀerent graphs to understand the diﬀerent characteristics of the data 
like hidden relationships among various features, which is not possible 
by simply looking at the dataset Table 3 . 
3.2.3. Feature engineering 
Feature engineering is one of the most fundamental and important 
parts of data preparation before moving further to model training and 
evaluation. In this stage, new features are created based on EDA per- 
formed on the dataset and existing knowledge of the domain of the 
dataset to improve the performance of the model. It is one of the most 
diﬃcult and time-consuming parts of data preparation. Surveys show 
that data scientists spend almost 80% of their time on data preparation. 
The new features are created based on diﬀerent calculations between 
the existing features. The new features might be a ratio, or a mathemat- 
ical transformation or any statistical or scientiﬁc formula to generate a 
more signiﬁcant feature. Feature engineering can be done both manu- 
ally by statisticians and by using feature encoding techniques in the case 
of categorical variables. There is a general misconception that feature 
engineering can only be beneﬁcial for linear regression or text classiﬁ- 
cation problems. Feature engineering has proved to be greatly beneﬁ- 
cial for support vector machines, random forests, neural networks, and 
gradient boosting machines. Encoding is important as machine learn- 
ing itself is based on mathematical models and algorithms, so most of 
the algorithms cannot classify between categorical and continuous val- 
ues. Encoding follows two methodologies: nominal and ordinal. Nomi- 
nal Encoding is performed where the order of the data is not of much 
importance and vice-versa. 
Apart from encoding, there are other techniques for feature engi- 
neering such as normalization. Normalization is used for scaling all the 
values in a dataset in a ﬁxed range between 0 and 1. The formula used 
for normalization is. 
𝑋 𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 = 
𝑋 − 𝑋 𝑚𝑖𝑛 
𝑋 𝑚𝑎𝑥 − 𝑋 𝑚𝑖𝑛 
Although it does improve the numerical scalability of the model, it 
should not be used always it can harm the performance of a model. 
3.2.4. Dimensionality reduction 
Dimensionality Reduction is simply reducing the dimensionality of 
your features. There are two approaches to the process: Feature Selec- 
tion and Feature Extraction. In this analysis, only feature selection is 
utilized to reduce the dimensionality of the feature set as feature extrac- 
tion is more suitable for data used for pattern recognition or image pro- 
cessing where meaningful inferences cannot be obtained just by looking 
at the data. 
3.2.4.1. Feature selection. Having all features considered for modelling 
can reduce the predictability of the model. It is always preferred to se- 
lect features that contribute more to the target variable. It can be done 
using manual methods like univariate selection where each feature is 
evaluated to decipher its importance. Statistical methods like variance 
and Pearson correlation are used for univariate analysis. But univariate 
analysis is more reliable when the data is linear, also it is exceedingly 
diﬃcult to perform univariate analysis on a large dataset. In such a case, 
the multivariate analysis can be performed. There are three methods of 
performing multivariate analysis: ﬁlter, wrapper and embedded. 
Following are the feature selection methods used in the analysis: 
3.2.4.1.1. Chi-Square test. It is a type of statistical ﬁlter method that 
is used to evaluate the correlation between diﬀerent features using their 
frequency distribution. In this method, feature selection is based on the 
intrinsic properties of the features and is independent of any ML algo- 
rithm. 
3.2.4.1.2. Recursive feature elimination (RFE). It is a type of wrapper 
method used for feature selection. The term “wrapper ”is used because 
this method wraps up a classiﬁer in a feature selection algorithm. In RFE, 
features are recursively removed from the dataset based on an external 
estimator used which is the classiﬁer. The classiﬁer assigns weights to a 
feature based on its performance. It is a greedy algorithm that seeks to 
generate the best performing subset. 
3.2.4.1.3. Tree-based feature selection. It is a type of embedded 
method in which there is an inbuilt method for feature importance 
which generates a set of features along with their importance. Embed- 
ded methods can be used with the help of algorithms that have inbuilt 
feature selection methods. 
3.3. Model selection 
After the data preparation is done and the data is divided into train- 
ing and testing tests, suitable models need to be selected to do the train- 
ing. Since it is a classiﬁcation problem, appropriate classiﬁers need to 
be selected to conduct the classiﬁcation. Both the datasets used in the 
analysis fall under the category of binary classiﬁcation. The classiﬁca- 
tion algorithms used in this analysis are Logistic Regression, Random 
Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, 
Bernoulli Naïve Byes, Mixed Naïve Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors. 
3.4. Model training 
After model selection, the training data is trained using the models 
selected with all features initially. Then, classiﬁcation algorithms are 
applied only to the features that are selected through feature selection 
techniques. 
3.5. Model evaluation and comparison 
Finally, the models are compared with each other along with the fea- 
ture selection techniques to come up with the best model and feature 
selection technique for the two datasets. Four metrics are used to evalu- 
ate the models in the analysis: Precision, Recall, F1 Score and Accuracy. 
All four metrics are given equal importance rather than relying on one 
performance metric. 
4. Experimentation results 
The analysis consists of two case studies: one of the health insurance 
sector and the other one of the travel insurance sector. The output in 
both cases is diﬀerent as shown in Fig. 1 . The ﬁrst one is from the per- 
spective of the beneﬁciary and the second one is from the perspective 
of the insurance company. 
4.1. Case Study 1: health insurance 
For the case study, the dataset is obtained from Kaggle.com. It con- 
sists of 1338 rows and 9 columns: 8 features and 1 target variable. 
Table 2 describes the features and target variable of the dataset for bet- 
ter understanding. 
Once the data is collected, the next step is data preparation. First, 
the data is checked for any missing values. There are no missing values 
in the dataset. Next, diﬀerent statistics of the features are observed. 
Before proceeding further for EDA, one-hot encoding is performed 
for the feature ‘region’ to better understand the distribution of policy- 
holders in diﬀerent regions along with other features. The feature itself 
is removed from the dataset and four new features ‘NorthEast USA’,

By observing Fig. 3 , it can be inferred that the policyholders having 
a BMI between 14 and 24 claim the least, policyholders having a BMI 
between 24–29 have a neutral response and the policyholders with a 
BMI of more than 29 are most likely to ﬁle a claim. Also, it can be 
concluded that the age bracket of 29–39 has the maximum number of 
policyholders that have not ﬁled a claim. 
By observing Fig. 4 , it can be inferred that while most of the smok- 
ers ﬁle a claim, non-smokers are neutral towards ﬁling a claim and the 
sex of the policyholder does not aﬀect the same. Whether a male or fe- 
male, if the policyholder is a smoker, he or she will most probably ﬁle a 
claim. 
From Fig. 5 , it can be inferred that policyholders with charges less 
than 9999 are least likely to ﬁle a claim and policyholders with charges 
more than 39,999 are going to ﬁle a claim. It can also be inferred that 
policyholders with an average of 3–6k steps day claim the most and 
the policyholders with more than 6k steps per day claim the least and 
the policyholders with no children claim the most. Apart from these 
ﬁndings, it is also observed that the policyholders of NorthWest USA 
are neutral to ﬁling a claim while policyholders of SouthEast USA are 
more likely to ﬁle a claim as compared to other regions. 
The ﬁnal set of features selected before proceeding to feature selec- 
tion are ‘age’, ‘sex’, ‘BMI’, ‘steps’, ‘children’, ‘smoker’, ‘NorthEast USA’, 
‘NorthWest USA’, ‘SouthEast USA’, ‘SouthWest USA’, ‘charges’ and the 
target variable ‘insurance claim’. 
From Table 6 and Fig. 8 , it can be inferred that Logistic Regression, 
Random Forest and Decision Tree Classiﬁers show the best performance. 
The Decision Tree Classiﬁer has the best performance among these three 
as three out of the four performance metrics have a higher value in 
Decision Tree classiﬁer as compared to the rest of the two classiﬁers. 
One thing to note is that no single performance evaluation metric is 
given more importance. 
Now, once again the dataset is trained using the same eight classi- 
ﬁers but with feature selection techniques to observe the changes in the 
result as well as evaluate the best feature selection technique for all the 
classiﬁers. 
From Table 7 and Fig. 8 , it can be inferred that the Logistic Regres- 
sion, Random Forest and Decision Tree Classiﬁers show the best perfor- 
mance once again. Random Forest is the best among these three classi- 
ﬁers as all four of its performance metrics have a higher value than the 
rest of the classiﬁers. Using Chi-Squared Test, four features are elimi- 
nated leaving the dataset with seven features: ‘age’, ‘BMI’, ‘steps’, ‘chil- 
dren’, ‘smoker’, ‘NorthWest USA’ and ‘Southeast USA’. The performance 
of the SVM Classiﬁer has decreased, there is an improvement in the per- 
formance of Gaussian and Mixed NB Classiﬁers & the performance of 
the KNN Classiﬁer has increased tremendously. 
From Table 8 and Fig. 8 , it can be inferred that Logistic Regression, 
Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gaussian NB and Mixed NB show the 
best performance. Random Forest is once again the best among all the 
classiﬁers. Logistic Regression, Gaussian NB and Mixed NB show equal 
performance. The performance of SVM, Gaussian NB, Bernoulli NB and 
Mixed NB classiﬁers increased, the rest of the classiﬁers’ performance 
has decreased as compared to the results obtained from the Chi-Squared 
Test. As Chi-Squared Test is a statistical test and has no involvement of 
any ML model, the number of features considered important by this 
test i.e. seven is considered as the number of comparing all the feature 
selection techniques. The seven most important features selected using

category when the policyholders are female & Number of Claims and the smoking category when the policyholders are male. 
RFE are: ‘NorthEast USA’, ‘age’, ‘BMI’, ‘charges’, ‘children’, ‘smoker’ and 
‘steps’. 
From Table 9 and Fig. 8 , it can be inferred that Logistic Regression, 
Random Forest and Decision Tree classiﬁers show the best performance. 
Decision Tree is the best among all the classiﬁers. Except for the Deci- 
sion Tree, all the classiﬁers’ performance has decreased as compared to 
RFE. The seven most important features selected using the Tree-Based 
Feature Importance Method are: ‘children’, ‘steps’, ‘BMI’, ‘charges’, ‘age’, 
‘smoker’ and ‘sex’. 
By observing the performance of all the eight classiﬁers with and 
without feature selection it can be concluded that Decision Tree is the 
best classiﬁer without feature selection and Random Forest is the best 
classiﬁer with feature selection. RFE is the best feature selection method 
as most of the models performed their best after RFE. KNN is the only 
classiﬁer that performed best with the features selected by Chi-Squared 
Test. Decision Tree gives the best result with the Tree-Based method. Lo- 
gistic Regression gives the best result without feature selection. Gaussian 
NB and Mixed NB produce the same results in all the cases; hence it can 
be concluded that continuous variables are more important than cate- 
gorical variables for the dataset. The best set of features, therefore, is: 
‘NorthEast USA’, ‘age’, ‘BMI’, ‘charges’, ‘children’, ‘smoker’ and ‘steps’. 
4.2. Case study 2: travel insurance 
For the case study, the dataset is obtained from Kaggle.com. It con- 
sists of 62,288 rows and 12 columns: 11 features and 1 target variable. 
7

Fig 5. Graphical representation of the relationship between Number of Claims by the policyholder and the Charges billed by the health insurance, Number of Claims 
and the average walking steps of the policyholder per day & Number of Claims and the number of children of the policyholder. 
Table 4 describes the features and target variable for a better under- 
standing of the dataset. 
Once the data is collected, the next step is data preparation. First, 
the data is checked for any missing values. There are 39,575 missing 
values for Gender i.e. 63.54 %. Hence, the column is dropped from the 
dataset before proceeding for further evaluation. Also, the ID column is 
dropped as it has no signiﬁcance in predicting claim acceptance. Next, 
diﬀerent statistics of the features are observed. 
According to the statistics observed as in Table 5 , the maximum age 
is 118 which is not a suitable age to travel for anybody, also most of 
the insurance companies do not provide insurance to people above 85 
years of age, hence considering 100–118 as an outlier category which 
comprises of 1.44% of the total policyholders, it is replaced by 99 hence 
keeping 99 as the maximum age of a policyholder. The minimum neg- 
ative value of Net Sales is justiﬁed as net sales are calculated as the 
diﬀerence between the value for which the insurance was sold and the 
expenses incurred, or the claim amount paid by the insurance company 
to the policyholder/beneﬁciary. So the net sale may be negative if the 
claim amount paid or even if the claim amount is not paid it can be neg- 
ative when the claim is rejected and the expenses incurred for doing the 
investigation is more than the actual policy amount paid by the policy- 
holder. The minimum value of duration is -2 is which not possible under 
any circumstances and the maximum value is 4881. Even if the unit for 
the duration is considered to be in days then also this value is not possi- 
ble as travel insurance policies can be applied for a maximum duration 
of 1–2 years in the case of an Annual Plan. Considering a maximum du- 
ration of 731 days i.e. one year and one leap year, the values above 731 
and below 1 are imputed as they constitute only 0.026% of the whole 
dataset. Values above 731 are imputed as 731 and values below 1 are 
imputed by the median value of duration. 
By observing Fig. 6 , it can be inferred that Net Sales and Acceptance 
% are directly proportional to each other and only 3 agencies have a 
good amount of sales. Also, Agency ‘C2B’ despite having high net sales 
and acceptance % provide a low commission to the mediator or maybe 
most of their sales are direct and there is no mediator in between. 
From Fig. 7 , it can be inferred that products having high Commis- 
sion Value have high Net Sales as well as high Acceptance %. Apart 
from these ﬁndings, it is also observed that most of the Travel Agency

claims are denied and despite having a low count of claims under Air- 
lines Agency, around 40% of the claims are accepted. Before moving 
onto the next comparison, the age is divided into three groups: Child 
(less than 21 years old), Adult (21–50 years old) and Senior (above 50 
years old). 
The next step after EDA is Feature Engineering. In this stage, label, 
dummy, and frequency encoding are performed to deal with the cate- 
gorical columns. Frequency Encoding is done for Destination, Agency, 
and Product Name columns. Dummy Encoding is done for Agency 
Type and Distribution Channel columns & Label Encoding is performed 
for Destination Category. Destination Category is decided based on 
Destination Risk. Destination Risk is calculated based on the count 
of claims. If the value is more than 0.3 i.e. more than 30% of the 
policyholders (travellers) have claimed the destination is marked as 
‘High Risk’. Similarly, if the value of risk is between 0.2 and 0.3, 
then the destination is marked as ‘Moderate Risk’ and if the value 
of risk is between 0 and 0.2, then the destination is marked as ‘Low 
Risk’. 
The ﬁnal set of features selected before proceeding to fea- 
ture selection are ‘Age’, ‘Commission (in value)’, ‘Duration’, 
‘Net Sales’, ‘Dest_freq_encoding’, ‘Agency_freq_encoding’, Prod- 
uct_Name_freq_encoding’, ‘Destination Category (labels)’, ‘Agency 
Type_Travel Agency’, ‘Distribution Channel_Online’ and the target 
variable ‘Claim’. 
After feature engineering, the next step is to do dimensionality re- 
duction. In both the datasets, as previously discussed there is no need 
for feature extraction. In this section, ﬁrst of all, both the datasets are 
trained and evaluated using the aforementioned eight classiﬁers without 
performing feature selection. Then feature selection is performed using 
three diﬀerent methods, namely ﬁlter, wrapper and embedded methods 
& then the models are evaluated using four performance metrics. The 
feature selection techniques used under these methods in this analysis 
are the Chi-Squared Test, Recursive Feature Elimination using Logistic 
Regression Classiﬁer & Tree-Based Feature Importance using ExtraTrees 
Classiﬁer. 
From Table 10 and Fig. 9 , it can be inferred that Random Forest, 
Decision Tree and KNN show the best performance. Random Forest is 
best among all the classiﬁers as all four of its performance metrics have 
a higher value than the rest of the classiﬁers. 
Now, once again the dataset is trained using the same eight classi- 
ﬁers but with feature selection techniques to observe the changes in the

classiﬁers. 
From Table 11 and Fig. 9 , it can be inferred that Random For- 
est, Decision Tree and KNN classiﬁers show the best performance. 
Random Forest is once again the best among all the classiﬁers. 
Using Chi-Squared Test, only one feature is discarded leaving the 
dataset with nine features: ‘Age’, ‘Commission (in value)’, ‘Dura- 
tion’, ‘Net Sales’, ‘Dest_freq_encoding’, ‘Agency_freq_encoding’, ‘Prod- 
uct_Name_freq_encoding’, ‘Destination Category (labels)’ and ‘Agency

maining classiﬁers has decreased as compared to modelling without fea- 
ture selection. 
From Table 12 and Fig. 9 , it can be inferred that Random Forest, 
Decision Tree and KNN classiﬁers show the best performance. Random 
Forest is the best among all the classiﬁers used for the dataset. Except 
for Decision Tree and KNN, the rest all the classiﬁers have increased 
performance as compared to the results of the Chi-Squared Test. Also,

pared to its performance without any feature selection technique. As

RFE are: ‘Age’, ‘Agency Type_Travel Agency’, ‘Commission (in value)’,

to RFE. The nine best features selected by the Tree-Based Feature Im- 
portance method are: ‘Duration’, ‘Age’, ‘Net Sales’, ‘Dest_freq_encoding’, 
‘Commission (in value)’, ‘Agency_freq_encoding’, ‘Destination Cate- 
gory (labels)’, ‘Product_Name_freq_encoding’ and ‘Agency Type_Travel 
Agency’. These are the same features as selected by Chi-Squared Test. 
The performance of the models using both feature selection methods is 
also almost the same. 
By observing the performance of all the eight classiﬁers with and 
without feature selection it can be concluded that Random Forest is 
the best classiﬁer both with and without feature selection. Chi-Squared 
and Tree-Based Feature Importance methods are the best feature se- 
lection techniques for the dataset as four models perform their best 
with features selected from these two. The slight diﬀerence between 
the results of these two techniques is neglected as both have selected 
the same set of features and any ML model trains itself continuously & 
both the techniques are not applied parallelly. Gaussian NB and Mixed 
NB produce the same results in all the cases; hence it can be con- 
cluded that continuous variables are more important than categorical

variables for the dataset. Bernoulli NB classiﬁer performs best without 
any feature selection. Therefore, the best set of features for the dataset 
is: ‘Duration’, ‘Age’, ‘Net Sales’, ‘Dest_freq_encoding’, ‘Commission (in 
value)’, ‘Agency_freq_encoding’, ‘Destination Category (labels)’, ‘Prod- 
uct_Name_freq_encoding’ and ‘Agency Type_Travel Agency’. 
5. Discussion 
With the help of the experimentation conducted, various character- 
istics of the client strata have been deduced in correlation with the in- 
surance claim and claim status. Further, machine learning models have 
been used to train the model to predict the claim status/insurance claim 
with accuracy ( Testoni & Boeri, 2015 ) . Feature selection techniques are 
used to reduce the dimensionality of the datasets as well as increase the 
accuracy of the trained models Guo & Yu (2016) . The results have been 
further discussed in the following section. Claim Analysis of both the 
datasets is performed successfully with the help of eight classiﬁcation 
algorithms. For both datasets, Random Forest is the best classiﬁer with 
suitable feature selection methods. For the ﬁrst and second dataset, Lo- 
gistic Regression and Bernoulli NB classiﬁers have performed better with 
all the features. Also, the KNN classiﬁer has performed better with Chi- 
Squared Test in the case of both the datasets despite the Chi-Squared 
Test being a ﬁlter method that selects features solely based on their cor- 
relation with each other based on their frequency distribution. Although 
wrapper methods like RFE improve the model’s performance by a bet- 
ter margin than the ﬁlter and embedded methods, it is not always the 
same, as observed in the analysis. The performance of the feature selec- 
tion method also depends on the dataset, the models used for training 
and evaluation of the dataset & the models used for feature selection. 
In the analysis, LogisticRegression and ExtraTrees classiﬁers are used 
with RFE and Tree-Based Feature Importance embedded method, re- 
spectively. The choice of model used to ﬁt the dataset for RFE is not 
much of a concern, it will not bring a huge lot of diﬀerence in the per- 
formance of the model. ExtraTrees classiﬁer is used for the Tree-Based 
Feature Importance method as it is an extremely randomized classiﬁer 
and is computationally less expensive than other tree-based algorithms. 
Unlike the results of the healthcare insurance dataset, all the eight clas- 
siﬁers used in the travel insurance dataset perform extremely well as 
wells as the Chi-Squared Test identiﬁes nine out of the ten features se- 
lected for model training as important. This is because the features of 
the second dataset are highly engineered already to increase the model’s 
performance. It is also observed that the data is high imbalanced based 
on the target variable in the second dataset, 80% of the claims are not 
accepted. This may result in biased predictions even though the model 
is properly trained. 
5.1. Theoretical contributions and implications 
It can be deduced that introducing technologies such as Machine 
Learning into the ﬁeld of insurance can be very helpful. InsurTech as a 
whole can help identify and understand the customer in a much better 
way than the narrow deﬁnition deﬁned by the insurance industry re- 
garding their needs and investing patterns ( Doupe et al., 2019 ; McGlade 
& Scott-Hayward, 2019 ). Using claim analysis, customer claiming pat- 
terns and their demography can be understood which can further help 
to improve policies and decide more viable premiums for the customers 
( Doupe et al., 2019 ; Karhade et al., 2019 ). Also, by understanding the 
insurance company’s acceptance patterns, the policies can be modiﬁed 
to monitor their proﬁt/loss ratio.

5.2. Implications for practice 
It is observed that using feature selection techniques is indeed 
very beneﬁcial before classifying data using classiﬁcation algorithms 
( Dave et al., 2021 ). Not all attributes are equally signiﬁcant and using 
feature selection techniques help to choose the best subset of attributes 
for optimal results ( Nian et al., 2016 ). It reduces the overﬁtting of data, 
increases the accuracy of the algorithm used and also reduces the com- 
putation time ( Larson & Sinclair, 2021 ). For example, in the Travel In- 
surance case study, using logistic regression with all attributes results 
in a model which has an accuracy of 0.750361, while using logistic re- 
gression along with tree-based feature selection results in an accuracy 
of 0.829347. 
6. Conclusions 
Despite the innumerable advantages of InsurTech only 28% of the 
big companies go for partnership with InsurTech companies and even 
less than 14% actively participate in incubator programs or ventures 
(water house Coopers 2016). Due to sparse partnerships, it is diﬃcult for 
new InsurTech companies to survive for long. This brings into question 
the sustainability of this model for scaling. Also, most of the funds of 
startups go into the distribution of policies which makes it diﬃcult for 
them to invest in other units of insurance i.e. underwriting, claims to 
service and maintain regulatory compliance. 
The future scope of this research work can be to address this prob- 
lem of high data imbalance using resampling of the dataset, clustering 
the abundant class or by simply applying Synthetic Minority Oversam- 
pling Technique (SMOTE), XGBoost or Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) 
algorithms .
